        "## What is RAG? 🤔\n",
        "We've all used ChatGPT and experienced moments when it starts to generate content that is often incorrect or unrelated to our query. Do you know why this happens? These Large Language Models (LLMs) are not magical entities; they are simply models trained on a vast amount of text. 📚 You could even consider a significant portion of the internet. However, this is not all the data available in the world, because data is not a static concept. You yourself generate some data every day through your use of the Internet, Social Media, and so on. 🌐💻📱\n",
        "\n",
        "So, no matter how much data you use to train your LLM, you always end up encountering new data. This is one of the reasons behind the famous ChatGPT response that tells you it only knows things up to a certain date. 📅 Also, these models tend to hallucinate too. It means they provide incorrect answers but in a very convincing manner. 🎭\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, we have retrieval techniques. Don't worry if it sounds complicated (it actually isn't easy, you may need to take a course to familiarize yourself with these concepts 😅, but that's not necessary for this project), but you use it on a daily basis. You can think of Search Engines (like Google, for example) as a complex form of information retrieval. 🔍\n",
        "\n",
        "So, one day, people came up with this idea that it would be cool if ChatGPT could search Google for us, read the articles for us, summarize what it read, and tell us that. 📖 So, this is not exactly what RAG is, but it's something similar. We have a corpus (a large amount of data) and a query (what a user typed as input). Now, we search through this corpus using techniques related to vectors and vector databases, and find the most similar items in our corpus to the query. Then, we pass these items to an LLM and ask for a structured, well-formatted, user-friendly output. 📈📊"

Initially, I wanted to use this article as the basis for this project, but unfortunately, the llama_index library used in the article seems to be outdated, so most of the code would need to be rewritten. On second thought, I found it more useful to focus on core concepts rather than learning specific libraries. You might want to check out some libraries like langchain or llama_index which provide a lot of tools for RAG. (But not for this project) 📝💡\n",
        "- Don't hesitate to use Google, ask chatbots about any new concepts and terms. If you use search engine-aware chatbots like Microsoft Copilot, they provide links for each part of their answers which is useful if you want to delve deeper into that part. 🌐🤖\n",

            "['I live in Vancouver as well and booking a flight to Colombia recently I noticed its much cheaper to get to MEX on a layover! Annoying., Are you checking bags? If so, dont do this. Itll cause all sorts of problems for you, the airline, and the other passengers on the flight., Just go up to the counter for your next flight and tell them you have diarrhea and you wont be boarding. Theyll be happy to use your seat for standbyers, its only a problem if they dont know if youre going to show up or not. Signed, an experienced skiplagger, Wouldnt be banned, but the practice for many airlines now is if you miss one and dont rebook nearly immediately, they will cancel the rest of your return flights, so best to do with one way bookings., I did it exactly once. International flight, originating in Atlanta. The return connected at Dulles, where I lived. I collected my bags and let the employees know that my company had changed my plans last minute and that I would not be boarding my connection. They checked my bags to baggage claim, warned me that it would be a long wait it was and sent me on my way. There were no further repercussions. I will point out that I was on a business class ticket at the time, so that may have helped smooth the way., For a one time happening? Highly unlikely. Who knows though. Good luck., Its called hidden city ticketing. Youre unlikely to get into trouble for doing it once since the reason for missing a single flight is not guessable. You could just have fallen asleep in the airport. You will be noticed if you do it repeatedly, especially on the same route., Its possible, because thats an intl route and more likely to raise eyebrows. But...if they ask, claim sickness and you should be good., International flights have a lot of cross country manifests that airlines prepare to let the outgoing and incoming countries know. Your flight is from Ecuador to Canada and you wanna exit in Mexico. I have done skip lagging within the US but never an international one like this. I would recommend letting the airline know definitely in Mexico that you dont plan on boarding the Canada flight but I am also concerned that if you do let the gate agent know if it is enough for the Canada immigration manifest to be updated. I would think yes considering every flight has noshows so there must be a system in place. But international skip lagging is not something i have done so I am curious how this works out. Give us an update later., Changing the date of the second leg is probably cheaper than a new ticket. call them its a decent airline., In addition to what others have said, there is always a risk of the original flight being cancelled and them rerouting you on a partner airline like Latam to Lima and then to Vancouver via LA, or on Delta via Atlanta. The airline is responsible for getting you from point A to point B with no guarantee of connection points. Its obviously a relatively small risk., remember that all these comments using unlikely means theres still a chance you will. you cannot check bags though, Actually, youre asking the wrong question. Youre not likely to be banned, especially if you at least go to the counter in Mexico, and tell them something like youre not feeling well and that youll fly later on. But the real question you should be asking is if AeroMexico will then take your Quito to Vancouver ticket and recalculate the fare as a oneway from Quito to Mexico and send you a bill for the price difference since you didnt complete the book itinerary in compliance with the contract of carriage that both you and AeroMexico agreed to. Because if they do that and you dont pay up, then its possible that you could either be pursued for the payment andbanned., Ive done this in the past few times, usually because my flight segments were and tight and the chance to delay nd flight was high risking getting stranded in another country and not catching the rd separated booking flight. But dont take checked luggage. You dont want them to unload your luggage and cause issues for them and other passengers. In CDMX, go to check in and ask to be checked out. You can explain them the reason and its fine. Im always doing this so gate agents wont wait for me call me at the gate. British even gave me a voucher for the unused flight and it was a super basic economy ticket I was shocked but said thank you , Its possible. Many airlines have addressed hidden city ticketingskiplagging as against the TOS and TCs. If it is a round trip ticket, it is entirely possible that the rest of your tickets will be canceled. Dont check any bags as they will be checked through all the way to Vancouver, and you will not be able to get them., They probably wont ban you from future use after a first offense, but they WILL cancel the rest of your ticket. Meaning you wont be able to fly home on the original itinerary., Ultimately what we say does not matter...the airline could ban you if they choose if it violates their policy. Not saying do it or no...just factor in the riskreward., They might. Do you have a back up plan?, OP here. Wow! So many comments. We are not checking luggage. This is the return part of our trip. I tried to reschedule and not possible. I was planning on telling AeroMexico some excuse as to why we would not be continuing. Hopefully, that clears up any confusion., How will you get your bags off if they think youre transiting?', 'Assuming its easy to check flight schedules and gates, there really isnt any reason to have constant announcements most of which arent clear enough to understand anyway. I transferred through Schiphol airport about a week ago and the lack of all those squawking announcements was nice and relaxing., SFO has a new silent terminal. Its amazing, I experienced my first silent airport recently and I loved it. I wish this existed universally., My local airport CGK is normal and busy with announcements we have a lot of firsttime and nervous travelers who greatly benefit from these, especially with how oblong and oddly shaped the airport is. However, if you step into one of the enclosed lounges, those are silent, as staff will personally inform passengers if their flight is departing. This is my preferred model normal and busy by default, but silent in lounges, workspaces, hotels etc. I can also elect to switch to silent by putting on my NC earbuds at any time., I love silent airports. The constant announcements at nonsilent airports continuously distract me and of the time theyre not relevant for me. However I unconsciously perk my ears every time something comes over the intercom. I prefer to wait and read in silence and take care of my own logistics through the airlines app or by keeping an eye on tv monitors., Love a truly silent airport, but things have to work there. I was just in the Kuala Lumpur airport supposedly silent, but they would announce final boarding calls and staff would quite literally shout boarding calls too, Silent. Although I was in Dubai recently, in the lounge, Stopped to use the toilet before going to the gate and got a phone call asking me to come to the gate. It was minutes before boarding was scheduled to start. I think I would prefer an announcement to a phone call while using the toilet, I can just say, people have different opinions on which they like better! Lol Tolbs, Are there any airports that ARENT silent now days? There are still local announcements at the gates, but I dont recall the last time I heard airportwide or even terminalwide announcements other than a few specific ones like looking for a single person who was presumably lost. That doesnt mean that things are silent. Many airports have gate areas that overlap, so its not uncommon to be hearing announcements from , , or more gates where you are but thats a function of the airport sizelayout., San Francisco has a silent terminal which I recently learned. Huge fan over here, I hate unnecessary noise., I thought silent was normal. Cant remember when I was last in one where they announced anything except near the gates with actual activity. Except of course the unattended bags must be reported., Silent please!, Normal. I like listening to the announcements, its part of the airport experience for me, There are so many announcements in Melbourne internatjonal and I think on balance I am not a fan and would just rather screens, I recently experienced this in Dubai and liked it. Just keep an eye on the screens, phones are also sending you push notifications nowadays when boarding starts. Set an alarm if necessary. Its not that difficult. In a big and very busy airport, constant announcements are just chaotic and annoying. There are no announcements when you have to get to the airport in time for your initial flight, so there isnt really a good reason why you shouldnt have that little bit of selforganising to reach your connection in time. Though, there actually still have been very few announcements for last calls in Dubai., Silent airports, most are now., Relatedly my biggest pet peeve is when flight boards loop through different pages of flights but show basically flights for the whole day at the same intervals so you have to sit and wait for like a full minutes to get back to the page with the flights in the next few hours. Nothing more helpful to someone rushing to a flight to have to wait through the nonupdates on flights leaving in hours for a few minutes so they can find their gate for their flight leaving in ., Will have to check it out when I go there., The atmosphere in the terminal is unrivaled, but I do find it a little stressful to be eatingordering in a close by part of the terminal with no auditory cues as to whether boarding has started. The Alaska app boarding notifications are easy to miss and I dont fully trust them yet. But I found the overall experience much more relaxing than the sensory overload during the first leg of the trip at Dulles, I believe they still make announcements at the gate without making it at the whole terminal or airport.', 'Waiters in Paris werent rude at all. People were friendly and helpful. I felt happy trying out my French and we all enjoyed laughing about my struggles , I picked Marseille as my base in southern France out of convenience to get to other towns for day trips but after reading opinions on Reddit I was expecting a dodgy ass, crime ridden town. Found a beautiful city with a beautiful port and beautiful people. Food was awesome too. Im from Chicago, I should have known better than to trust a bad rep haha., All my best travel experiences have been for work actually. I love interacting with everyday people who are not expats. I love traveling abroad to visit friends too but then Im mostly hanging out American expats. Im currently in India right now. Im in Bangalore visiting our office here. Its honestly been incredible seeing the culture here the good and the bad. Ive also had a bit of time to be a tourist and see a few sites. Im about to go to a coworkers house for Diwali. In the early s, I used to work for a company that had offices in Shanghai and Bangkok. I was working in Shanghai at the time and got sent to Bangkok regularly. In the mid s, I worked for big pharma and got sent to Europe all the time. All very eye opening and amazing. Edit to add Ive also traveled to less glamorous places around the US too and its all still great. It forced me out of my coastal bubble. Who knows when I would have had a non work reason to go to Louisville and Dallas since I dont have friends there and these cities are just not high on my list. Most of my vacation time is spent visiting family and attending weddings. Btw, I also LOVE Istanbul. Turkey in general is amazing., Was in Italy and kept going on day trips to what the Internet told me were quiet offthebeaten path places and found it very busy and with loads of tourists. My husband had the idea of just looking at random spots with google maps. Ended up going to Brisighella, which was exactly what we had been looking for. Turns out its on a list of most beautiful villages in Italy, and Id whole heartedly would agree., Botswana People ok, so you dont hear much about the place other than the safaris are amazing and they are!. The people! Were out on Safari just shooting pictures and one on our group loses her purse. Passport, money, phone everything I know!. She doesnt realize it until were back at camp and weve been everywhere on dirt roads and offroad. Our guide puts out a notice on the radio network they maintain for animal spotting. Would you believe she had it back the next day? Another tourist spotted it and turned it over to another guide. Our guide drive miles to retrieve it. Would you also believe that everything was there, including all her money?!! We asked how this was possible amongst such poverty that we saw. This could be triple someones annual salary. Our guide said our people are not jealous of you. It is an honor to help you enjoy your stay. All true. When someone asks me about what was the best part of my trip, I always have to include this. Botswana proud!, Everyone says to skip Naples, or to pretend that the city next to Vesuvius doesnt exist. I absolutely loved the city and its vibe and culture, its food and a severely underrated museum. Use common sense, and Naples is an absolute blast. Loved it, I dont know if this counts as positive but I felt very happy at this moment Im a late bloomer in travelling as in in a group of friends, I was the only one left that hasnt travelled. Im , my first international travel was January this year in Japan. The second I stepped foot in Shinjuku, I started crying. Its when I finally realized that I am out of the country, that Ive just completed a personal milestone. I was all over the place haha Safe to say Shinjuku will always have my heart., Bucharest in Romania. What a lovely city, loads of culture, arty vibe and super safe. Lovely friendly people., Cincinnati was surprisingly cool, Bucharestwe got a bit lost so asked a guy for directions. He ended up walking us there completely the opposite direction to where he was headed. He told us all about the history of the place on the way. Just a kind human being., Being from the west coast of the US, Ive always heard that east coasters move at a quicker pace and arent as friendlywont have time to stop for strangers. My first time in NYC, I had several strangers approach me to start a conversation or give me a compliment while I was wandering around alone. There was even a rich older lady next to me on a bench that ended up walking me around Central Park to show me her favorite spots. Ive also heard about the bad service in Paris, but everyone was really nice to us everywhere we went., Michoacn, Mexico. I went there last year during Da de muertos and was warned by so many people to avoid that state entirely. I felt completely safe in Morelia, and these other pueblos mgicos that i visited. The food was delicious and the people were so nice, Im glad I didnt listen to those people telling me I should stay away. The Da de muertos festivities were amazing there as well, I went to Taiwan with no preconceptions about how it would be and the people there were so generous. We booked an Airbnb and it was a bit far from a bus stop which we didnt realize so the owner upgraded us to a nicer property that was better for people with no car. He stocked the fridge with groceries and every day while we were exploring he would clean the apartment and restock the snacks. On the last day he took us on a wonderful tour and bought us the most amazing seafood meal I ever had. He apologized to us for not being able to be more attentive due to his religious commitments that week and we were so confused because he was far above and beyond the best host we ever had. Taiwan , Its kind of insignificant, but Ill always remember it. My first international trip was in Thailand with two friends who were a couple. The nights I had the most fun were the nights they wanted couples alone time. I went out solo and met so many cool people and had the best time. I decided I was going to go to Europe a few months later I was unemployed by choice and had saved a bunch of money before I quit. On my first solo trip, I landed in Berlin, Germany. I hadnt slept much on the night flight from Canada. I remember getting out of the plane and seeing all the German signs. I had been to Thailand and saw signs in Thai. They were a culture shock, but their writing is hard to distinguish as an English speaker. I never really bothered with trying to understand Thai signs. Landing in Germany was different. I recognized the letters but had no idea what the words meant. The words were huge. For some reason, it kind of made me more nervous. The airport was crazy and I finally got to a cab. My taxi driver didnt speak any English. I hadnt spoken to any other Germans at this point, so I didnt realize that most people in Germany do know basic English. I was in the back seat thinking, Oh God, did I bite off more than I can chew ? We started driving and he turned on the radio. One of my favorite songs started playing. This song isnt popular. I had never heard it played on the radio before. I had never even met another person who knew this song, lol. We started driving into the city, and the song pumped me up. All my nervousness went away. I got out into my hostel and saw English signs. The person at the front desk spoke in German and then switched to English with ease. I ended up having so much fun that I went back to Berlin at the end of the same trip weeks later. I love Germany and am learning the language now. Its kind of a silly story, but its one Ill never forget., Istanbul is my fav city in the entire world. I loved it more than Amsterdam, Barcelona and London. Perfect mix of the east and west, clean, hospitable people, incredibly inexpensive I live in San Francisco, and amazing food. I wasnt expecting much but my word, it blew me away., We did a NYC trip and decided to add in Washington DC for days. Not a long stay, and I wasnt expecting much, but I absolutely loved my time there. Also went to Georgetown for an afternoon and its still by far one of the cutest neighbourhoods Ive ever been to., Had an absolutely brilliant time in Morocco as a solo female traveller!, Plovdiv in Bulgaria. Its the perfect blend of interesting historical places, great food and nightlife. We mostly went to Bulgaria because we were on a budget, but it turned out to be one of the best trips Ive had in years. Also the nature in Bulgaria is mesmerizing., Was taking a taxi from Quebec City airport into old town. The driver didnt speak great English but when we told him where we were staying and how many days we had he made some suggestions that were useful. Rather than just hang in QC, he suggested renting a car and going towards Saquenay etc and hitting the small towns along the way., I love this. I LOVE Turkey.', 'Milan is fine but nothing overly special. A day or two to see the Duomo and other sights is worth it, but days would be overkill for most people. Maybe the fashion and clubbing will keep your friend happy the whole time, not something I am overly familiar with myself., Milan is absolutely decent, but it depends what youre into yourself. I think its reputation in this subreddit stems from comparisons to more historical cities architecture wise, however there is absolutely quite a bit to do. Also, its an actually living and economically well off city rather than a tourist Disneyland like what e.g. Venice is and what others like Florence are slowly becoming unfortunately. As a result, its quite a bit more Italian in an everyday life sense. Rome for instance is absolutely top notch in almost all ways, but once youre out and about exploring the centre most people youll be bumping into will be American families and German backpackers, while itll be Italian students and businesspeople in Milan. Apart from Pinacoteca Brera, which in itself is a great museum, you have quite a lot of technology and military focused museums, you have the Sforzesco castle bang in the middle, some interesting modern architecture green skyscrapers as well as the canals with a bustling nightlife. Food is good do some research on typical Lombard and Milanese dishes and youll have a blast, plus due to the fact that you always had a lot of migration from all parts of Italy to Milan it also offers any sort of Italian regional cuisine that you can imagine, from Abruzzo to le Marche. Its also rather safe and walkable. Onceif you do get enough of it the Alps are close, as are many other midsized Italian cities given Italys good high speed train network Verona, Parma, Modena, Bologna all about h away or less., Yes, its a commercial city. Its still nice to visit, but you dont need days. I live just over an hour away across the border, and only visit Milan for the airport and to buy clothes. When I go clubbing with friends we usually take the train to Torino and stay there for the weekend., I was in Milan last year for days around Christmas. It was nice. The cathedral, Christmas village and last supper were great. Day trip or overnight to lake como would be nice., Take the train from Milan and do daytrips. LuganoSwitzerland for example, also if you have a tight budget its much harder to enjoy yourselves, It was fine. To us it was very commercial. We didnt have any bad incidents but we felt it was a city that could be seen almost entirely in days. We always felt safe but we stayed pretty much in the downtown area. I havent been to other cities in Italy so I cant compare though, The towns around Milano are awesome Bergamo Lecco Etc Can always stay in Milan and day trip, I really like it. I was surprised by how many renaissance artworks the multiple museums have and we also love the fine dining aspect of it. Oh make sure you bring your friend to the fashion street and contemporary art museum. My favorite is Ambrosian Library and Brera. I spent half day on each and could easily spent more. So much to see. Francesco Messina museum is another one of my favorite. Duomo is just okayish for me in comparison. La Rosa, Seta and LAlchimia left us some memorable experience when it comes to fine dining. In short I guess it just worked so perfectly for us because after a long day of browsing museum we can just pop into a nice restaurant for a bottle of wine and cap the night with a negroni at some chill bar talking about that piece of art that kept us in awe., Do some day trips? I really loved lake Como., Milan is a business city. You can easily see it all in a day or two. You should be spending more time in cities like Florence and Siena., Milan, beside beibg the fashion capital of Italy, clubbing etc has a huge amount of museums and other cultural sites. Who says youll cover Milan on one day does not know what is talking about. In one day youll just cover Sforzas Castle. Do your researches, there are plenty of cultral sites to see., I didnt like it much when I was there days is way to long, I spent days in Milan and wish I could have spent an extra day albeit it not at the expense of anywhere else we went Its not on my hall of fame city list but its worth visiting for a few days before going onto Lake Como, Verona, etc., there are great museums in milan! especially the novacento and the pinacoteca di brera. i also prefer historical sights to fashion and clubbing but i enjoyed milan. there were even museums that i couldnt go to bc i didnt have enough time. also you can take day trips out of milan, we went to pavia which was super pretty, I dont know, I didnt mind it, food was good, public transportation was easy, and honestly it doesnt matter just make use of the train system. If youre staying in Milan you can hop a train to Lake Como, Verona, like any number of nearby towns and cities. Really quick and not particularly expensive. If you get bored of Milan, day trip somewhere else., If you like spas, there is an excellent and very reasonably priced spa called QC Terme in the centre. You can easily spend a whole day there. You can also take the train to the beautiful Lake Como., Personally I think its a very grande and majestic city. Its one of the fashion capitals of the world and theres a certain elegance to the general atmosphere. Perhaps thats not your vibe, but I liked it. I feel like a superstar walking down Via Monte Napoleone and the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is supposed to be magical at Christmas time. You could do a day trip to the Lake Como area if you want to break up your time there., Visit Como andor Bergamo. Not very far, One cool thing to see in Milan is the old cemetery because its like an open museum with tons of beautiful monuments and tombs.', 'One thing I really like to do is sit on a public bench on a busy street and just observe. Not doing anything, just being there. At moments like that I feel that I am truly privileged to keep doing this., I was working up in North Queensland, on a day off we went Barramundi fishing in croc country, the stuff dreams are made of. One of blokes we were with was just sitting down on his phone the whole time not fishing or anything and was watching videos on Instagram. I had a look over his shoulder to see what he was watching and he was watching videos of people Barramundi fishing. Its very common these days for some unknown reason to prefer watching someone else having fun than actually have fun yourself., I usually like to read up on what or where Im visiting to help with taking in the whole experience. I read about it as I sitstand there. It enriches the experience by helping me visualize what happened in that location or in the creation of it., As youve just discovered being present requires time so the experience can sink in. That happens to me when I have a chance to be somewhere long enough. Its not always possible. Ive been to Machu Picchu and consider it one of the most amazing places Ive visited but for obvious technical reasons did not have time to fully absorb its majesty. But Ive also had a chance to stay in Belmond hotel in Iguazu and that has completely changed the experience of admiring the waterfalls. If I can stay in one place for a while being in the moment just happens. Im in Buenos Aires rn and will be here for about a month total, thats very different than hitting all the attractions in days and moving on., I was just in Ayutthaya,Thailand. Although Im sure other people lived there before this, it was originally settled and given a name by the Khmer people around AD, and became the second capital of Siam in , and was renamed. It was captured by the Burmese in , and then sacked in . Obviously, theres more to it than that. But, knowing some of the history of what Im seeing is helpful in my ability to truly appreciate the significance, and to see it more clearly. However, while there, I noticed that the majority of people were just taking quick pictures and selfies with the ruins, and then rushing off to the next spot. Now, to be clear, I dont care how others spend their time. But its still something that I notice. Also, Im quite sure Ive done the same, or similar, during my travels. I know I can have moments of mindlessness, just like anyone else. So, I can understand what youre saying. But I also just choose to try to do some research before visiting a location, and try to understand its significance in both a global perspective at the time of its greatest useactivity, and how its existence has shaped history up to the current age. Then again, sometimes I dont want to be overly analytical, and just enjoy seeing something cool, with a little bit of understanding about it., Definitely through drawingsketching. It requires a physical and mental pause plus deep noticing. Even if the drawing turns out awful sometimes they do its still a nice moment., In , I went to the est places I could find, tallest building in Dubai, oldest pub in Ireland, oldest house in London, etc. I am so glad I took videos of them all. I enjoy viewing them again once in a while. Even have them all in my YouTube. Totallyh worth it., I tend to take a lot of photos of places albeit now not as many as when I first started travelling but I think sometimes just loving the places I am visiting has helped me be present. I love history and so I try to visit the sites that interest me as well as museums. And when I visit museums, I try to actually read the little bits of information. Has that resulted in me spending literal hours in museums? Yes, but i love it., I bought a point and shoot digital camera and leave my phone off in the bag in case of emergency. Keeps me off my phone and its fun to use a camera. Need directions, ask a local. Spark up conversation. Looking for a place to eat, look for a local, ask them. They might even go with you or say go here and tell them I sent you. Ive also done this with a partner or friend that Im traveling with. Today, you are the navigator and phone person. Im leaving mine in the room. Then the next day, you take phone responsibilities. Youll find by the end, both of you are on your phones way less and neither wants the phone responsibilities. Also the times where your both on your phones go away and the phone person feels bad being on their phone around you., Went to Alhambra, the architecture was breathtaking. I took pictures too. But for me it was to think about what was this place like for the people who were there. Alhambra was the palace for sultans ruling Granada for centuries. Someone was born there, got married there, had kids there, and died there. I imagine their life moments as they happened. I was standing in the same place as they did but the only dimension different was time. We dont know yet how to go back on time dimension and time can only travel forward, but history brought their time to me. Thats how I do it, I kind of had the same realisation when looking at David. Technically the whole of Galleria dell Accademia can be done in a few minutes. But I was listening to Rick Steves audio guide and that helped me appreciate the sculpture way better. I stayed near David for some time after the guide ended. Imagining it at the top of the red Dome. Imagining the Dome itself being built. I felt transported to a time long long ago., Over the years I have taken out my phone less and less as I travel to be in the moment of what Im experiencing or witnessing! I dont find myself flicking through photos to relive a moment and its very rare I ever pull out my phone to show someone one of the rare instances I did take a picture. I talk about it how it was, what it looked like, how it felt and I think people get more of a sense of how great or bad or scary or crazy an experience was vs looking at a static photo! As Im discussing everything Im reliving all of it and not missing bits and pieces because I was more concerned with taking the perfect picture! If someone asks me a questions I can usually answer it and now I have fun library of trivia I can throw at people because I was more focused on listening or doing or being than clicking a button for a photo that Im probably going to later question was this Arizona or Nevada because they were almost identical photowise. I was at the tea farm in South Carolina and people were literally taking photos of the little plastic pots of dirt instead of listening to the tour guide! Dirt!! I laughed because all I could think about is if they did go back and look at them or show someone what would they say!? Oh ya, they grow tea in dirt I have a European trip coming up in about . months and Im going to do exactly what Ive been doing, live in the moment with my phone in my pocket and when we are just hanging out with nothing better to do, I make snap a photo or two of US with a fun background and then put it right back!, The number of times Ive been told I only need the time Ive allocated to a destination is many more times than the actual number of destinations Ive visited lol. Taking it a bit slower Id never a bad thing and leaves tons of opportunities to just be. You never have to rush through attractions to keep on schedule could even take in a second visit if it was desired, plus you have time to see and do things that are likely as good but are free of the crowds that concentrate on the super famous spots. No phones at restaurants has also been a great rule because it allows for the opportunity to just be a fly on the wall., Along with sitting down and observing life at a slower pace, I utilise all my senses to create a happy place memory at somewhere I find relaxing. I think to myself what am I hearing? Waves, birds, music?, what are the aromas? Food, coffee, fragrance? Touch, is the sun warming my skin, are my feet dipped in the sea? Building the complete rounded memory which you can return to whenever you choose., I also have a deep contempt for the checklist travelers that lives somewhere between pity and disgust. To me its so much better to plan your days agenda in broad concepts, and then let your observations and mood dictate what you do and what direction you go., Everyone travels differently obviously, but Ive always been the type to soak in the place Im visiting. When I travel somewhere I like ticking off a few things off my bucket list but I also leave a lot of time to just enjoy the city. For example I recently went to Bali but didnt do many of the main attractions there. I stayed in a local area and enjoyed time with locals, visiting local temples and so on. Yeah my Instagram is not perfect but does it need to be?, One of my favorite travel moments was visiting Maiden Castle. Otherwise hardly known to be an eventful attraction, it was so special. I had really wanted to visit it, but the only way I could required walking from the station at Dorchester miles away doable, but hardly an exciting walk I thought. It turned out having to walk made is so much more magical. Looking out across the land with the farms and fields and then seeing the massive mound that is Maiden Castle directly ahead come into view was amazing. It was like I was a Roman soldier, sans sword and sandals. One of untold numbers who have come to this place for millennia. You could practically feel the ancient site. That set the mood just right for exploring the site itself. Wandering up, down, and around it, it is hard to describe, but I somehow became totally engrossed by it. You could feel the place, from understanding the odd geographic authority of the place to lives long forgotten who have done the same. The only other visitors were sheep, birds, and a fox., I hiked with my family to The Wave in Arizona. Its a petrified sand dune. Think of it as an undulating sandstone formation with bands of bright color. You can google it for a better idea. The government grants a handful of passes to visit each day and hiking to it is miles one way through desert. In some places you hike over slickrock and the trails are not well marked. But once you get there, its very peaceful. With few people there, you can really take your time and drink it in. I watched some groups stay for minutes and leave. But we spent hours watching the light play across the sandstone and just being there, reflecting on what it was like to have the place nearly to ourselves. I like to do this thing I call saving up a moment I can live inside forever. Ill try to take an impression about everything in that moment. The way the wind sounds, how the sun feels on my skin. What I see as I sit there. How it makes me feel. Taking mental pictures. Now when I want to feel that sense of peace, I shut my eyes and put myself back in that place, sitting on the crest of a sand dune wave. It was a once in a lifetime thing, but its not just some thing I once did. I carry it with me., Same. In all my travels I like to buy some food and then sit on a bench in a busy street or monument. It really gives you time to realize you are there and reflect on how you got and that point in life. Also, it makes you appreciate local food better., I have a friend that I go on city breaks with a lot. One of our favourite things to do is sit down outside a bar in a busy area and just look around us at the architecture, the scenery, and the people and just soak it all in. We invited a friend on one of our trips this year, and she could not get on board with it at all. She felt that any time not in a museum or art gallery was wasted time.']\n"

            "I live in Vancouver as well and booking a flight to Colombia recently I noticed its much cheaper to get to MEX on a layover! Annoying., Are you checking bags? If so, dont do this. Itll cause all sorts of problems for you, the airline, and the other passengers on the flight., Just go up to the counter for your next flight and tell them you have diarrhea and you wont be boarding. Theyll be happy to use your seat for standbyers, its only a problem if they dont know if youre going to show up or not. Signed, an experienced skiplagger, Wouldnt be banned, but the practice for many airlines now is if you miss one and dont rebook nearly immediately, they will cancel the rest of your return flights, so best to do with one way bookings., I did it exactly once. International flight, originating in Atlanta. The return connected at Dulles, where I lived. I collected my bags and let the employees know that my company had changed my plans last minute and that I would not be boarding my connection. They checked my bags to baggage claim, warned me that it would be a long wait it was and sent me on my way. There were no further repercussions. I will point out that I was on a business class ticket at the time, so that may have helped smooth the way., For a one time happening? Highly unlikely. Who knows though. Good luck., Its called hidden city ticketing. Youre unlikely to get into trouble for doing it once since the reason for missing a single flight is not guessable. You could just have fallen asleep in the airport. You will be noticed if you do it repeatedly, especially on the same route., Its possible, because thats an intl route and more likely to raise eyebrows. But...if they ask, claim sickness and you should be good., International flights have a lot of cross country manifests that airlines prepare to let the outgoing and incoming countries know. Your flight is from Ecuador to Canada and you wanna exit in Mexico. I have done skip lagging within the US but never an international one like this. I would recommend letting the airline know definitely in Mexico that you dont plan on boarding the Canada flight but I am also concerned that if you do let the gate agent know if it is enough for the Canada immigration manifest to be updated. I would think yes considering every flight has noshows so there must be a system in place. But international skip lagging is not something i have done so I am curious how this works out. Give us an update later., Changing the date of the second leg is probably cheaper than a new ticket. call them its a decent airline., In addition to what others have said, there is always a risk of the original flight being cancelled and them rerouting you on a partner airline like Latam to Lima and then to Vancouver via LA, or on Delta via Atlanta. The airline is responsible for getting you from point A to point B with no guarantee of connection points. Its obviously a relatively small risk., remember that all these comments using unlikely means theres still a chance you will. you cannot check bags though, Actually, youre asking the wrong question. Youre not likely to be banned, especially if you at least go to the counter in Mexico, and tell them something like youre not feeling well and that youll fly later on. But the real question you should be asking is if AeroMexico will then take your Quito to Vancouver ticket and recalculate the fare as a oneway from Quito to Mexico and send you a bill for the price difference since you didnt complete the book itinerary in compliance with the contract of carriage that both you and AeroMexico agreed to. Because if they do that and you dont pay up, then its possible that you could either be pursued for the payment andbanned., Ive done this in the past few times, usually because my flight segments were and tight and the chance to delay nd flight was high risking getting stranded in another country and not catching the rd separated booking flight. But dont take checked luggage. You dont want them to unload your luggage and cause issues for them and other passengers. In CDMX, go to check in and ask to be checked out. You can explain them the reason and its fine. Im always doing this so gate agents wont wait for me call me at the gate. British even gave me a voucher for the unused flight and it was a super basic economy ticket I was shocked but said thank you , Its possible. Many airlines have addressed hidden city ticketingskiplagging as against the TOS and TCs. If it is a round trip ticket, it is entirely possible that the rest of your tickets will be canceled. Dont check any bags as they will be checked through all the way to Vancouver, and you will not be able to get them., They probably wont ban you from future use after a first offense, but they WILL cancel the rest of your ticket. Meaning you wont be able to fly home on the original itinerary., Ultimately what we say does not matter...the airline could ban you if they choose if it violates their policy. Not saying do it or no...just factor in the riskreward., They might. Do you have a back up plan?, OP here. Wow! So many comments. We are not checking luggage. This is the return part of our trip. I tried to reschedule and not possible. I was planning on telling AeroMexico some excuse as to why we would not be continuing. Hopefully, that clears up any confusion., How will you get your bags off if they think youre transiting?\n",
            "Assuming its easy to check flight schedules and gates, there really isnt any reason to have constant announcements most of which arent clear enough to understand anyway. I transferred through Schiphol airport about a week ago and the lack of all those squawking announcements was nice and relaxing., SFO has a new silent terminal. Its amazing, I experienced my first silent airport recently and I loved it. I wish this existed universally., My local airport CGK is normal and busy with announcements we have a lot of firsttime and nervous travelers who greatly benefit from these, especially with how oblong and oddly shaped the airport is. However, if you step into one of the enclosed lounges, those are silent, as staff will personally inform passengers if their flight is departing. This is my preferred model normal and busy by default, but silent in lounges, workspaces, hotels etc. I can also elect to switch to silent by putting on my NC earbuds at any time., I love silent airports. The constant announcements at nonsilent airports continuously distract me and of the time theyre not relevant for me. However I unconsciously perk my ears every time something comes over the intercom. I prefer to wait and read in silence and take care of my own logistics through the airlines app or by keeping an eye on tv monitors., Love a truly silent airport, but things have to work there. I was just in the Kuala Lumpur airport supposedly silent, but they would announce final boarding calls and staff would quite literally shout boarding calls too, Silent. Although I was in Dubai recently, in the lounge, Stopped to use the toilet before going to the gate and got a phone call asking me to come to the gate. It was minutes before boarding was scheduled to start. I think I would prefer an announcement to a phone call while using the toilet, I can just say, people have different opinions on which they like better! Lol Tolbs, Are there any airports that ARENT silent now days? There are still local announcements at the gates, but I dont recall the last time I heard airportwide or even terminalwide announcements other than a few specific ones like looking for a single person who was presumably lost. That doesnt mean that things are silent. Many airports have gate areas that overlap, so its not uncommon to be hearing announcements from , , or more gates where you are but thats a function of the airport sizelayout., San Francisco has a silent terminal which I recently learned. Huge fan over here, I hate unnecessary noise., I thought silent was normal. Cant remember when I was last in one where they announced anything except near the gates with actual activity. Except of course the unattended bags must be reported., Silent please!, Normal. I like listening to the announcements, its part of the airport experience for me, There are so many announcements in Melbourne internatjonal and I think on balance I am not a fan and would just rather screens, I recently experienced this in Dubai and liked it. Just keep an eye on the screens, phones are also sending you push notifications nowadays when boarding starts. Set an alarm if necessary. Its not that difficult. In a big and very busy airport, constant announcements are just chaotic and annoying. There are no announcements when you have to get to the airport in time for your initial flight, so there isnt really a good reason why you shouldnt have that little bit of selforganising to reach your connection in time. Though, there actually still have been very few announcements for last calls in Dubai., Silent airports, most are now., Relatedly my biggest pet peeve is when flight boards loop through different pages of flights but show basically flights for the whole day at the same intervals so you have to sit and wait for like a full minutes to get back to the page with the flights in the next few hours. Nothing more helpful to someone rushing to a flight to have to wait through the nonupdates on flights leaving in hours for a few minutes so they can find their gate for their flight leaving in ., Will have to check it out when I go there., The atmosphere in the terminal is unrivaled, but I do find it a little stressful to be eatingordering in a close by part of the terminal with no auditory cues as to whether boarding has started. The Alaska app boarding notifications are easy to miss and I dont fully trust them yet. But I found the overall experience much more relaxing than the sensory overload during the first leg of the trip at Dulles, I believe they still make announcements at the gate without making it at the whole terminal or airport.\n",
            "Waiters in Paris werent rude at all. People were friendly and helpful. I felt happy trying out my French and we all enjoyed laughing about my struggles , I picked Marseille as my base in southern France out of convenience to get to other towns for day trips but after reading opinions on Reddit I was expecting a dodgy ass, crime ridden town. Found a beautiful city with a beautiful port and beautiful people. Food was awesome too. Im from Chicago, I should have known better than to trust a bad rep haha., All my best travel experiences have been for work actually. I love interacting with everyday people who are not expats. I love traveling abroad to visit friends too but then Im mostly hanging out American expats. Im currently in India right now. Im in Bangalore visiting our office here. Its honestly been incredible seeing the culture here the good and the bad. Ive also had a bit of time to be a tourist and see a few sites. Im about to go to a coworkers house for Diwali. In the early s, I used to work for a company that had offices in Shanghai and Bangkok. I was working in Shanghai at the time and got sent to Bangkok regularly. In the mid s, I worked for big pharma and got sent to Europe all the time. All very eye opening and amazing. Edit to add Ive also traveled to less glamorous places around the US too and its all still great. It forced me out of my coastal bubble. Who knows when I would have had a non work reason to go to Louisville and Dallas since I dont have friends there and these cities are just not high on my list. Most of my vacation time is spent visiting family and attending weddings. Btw, I also LOVE Istanbul. Turkey in general is amazing., Was in Italy and kept going on day trips to what the Internet told me were quiet offthebeaten path places and found it very busy and with loads of tourists. My husband had the idea of just looking at random spots with google maps. Ended up going to Brisighella, which was exactly what we had been looking for. Turns out its on a list of most beautiful villages in Italy, and Id whole heartedly would agree., Botswana People ok, so you dont hear much about the place other than the safaris are amazing and they are!. The people! Were out on Safari just shooting pictures and one on our group loses her purse. Passport, money, phone everything I know!. She doesnt realize it until were back at camp and weve been everywhere on dirt roads and offroad. Our guide puts out a notice on the radio network they maintain for animal spotting. Would you believe she had it back the next day? Another tourist spotted it and turned it over to another guide. Our guide drive miles to retrieve it. Would you also believe that everything was there, including all her money?!! We asked how this was possible amongst such poverty that we saw. This could be triple someones annual salary. Our guide said our people are not jealous of you. It is an honor to help you enjoy your stay. All true. When someone asks me about what was the best part of my trip, I always have to include this. Botswana proud!, Everyone says to skip Naples, or to pretend that the city next to Vesuvius doesnt exist. I absolutely loved the city and its vibe and culture, its food and a severely underrated museum. Use common sense, and Naples is an absolute blast. Loved it, I dont know if this counts as positive but I felt very happy at this moment Im a late bloomer in travelling as in in a group of friends, I was the only one left that hasnt travelled. Im , my first international travel was January this year in Japan. The second I stepped foot in Shinjuku, I started crying. Its when I finally realized that I am out of the country, that Ive just completed a personal milestone. I was all over the place haha Safe to say Shinjuku will always have my heart., Bucharest in Romania. What a lovely city, loads of culture, arty vibe and super safe. Lovely friendly people., Cincinnati was surprisingly cool, Bucharestwe got a bit lost so asked a guy for directions. He ended up walking us there completely the opposite direction to where he was headed. He told us all about the history of the place on the way. Just a kind human being., Being from the west coast of the US, Ive always heard that east coasters move at a quicker pace and arent as friendlywont have time to stop for strangers. My first time in NYC, I had several strangers approach me to start a conversation or give me a compliment while I was wandering around alone. There was even a rich older lady next to me on a bench that ended up walking me around Central Park to show me her favorite spots. Ive also heard about the bad service in Paris, but everyone was really nice to us everywhere we went., Michoacn, Mexico. I went there last year during Da de muertos and was warned by so many people to avoid that state entirely. I felt completely safe in Morelia, and these other pueblos mgicos that i visited. The food was delicious and the people were so nice, Im glad I didnt listen to those people telling me I should stay away. The Da de muertos festivities were amazing there as well, I went to Taiwan with no preconceptions about how it would be and the people there were so generous. We booked an Airbnb and it was a bit far from a bus stop which we didnt realize so the owner upgraded us to a nicer property that was better for people with no car. He stocked the fridge with groceries and every day while we were exploring he would clean the apartment and restock the snacks. On the last day he took us on a wonderful tour and bought us the most amazing seafood meal I ever had. He apologized to us for not being able to be more attentive due to his religious commitments that week and we were so confused because he was far above and beyond the best host we ever had. Taiwan , Its kind of insignificant, but Ill always remember it. My first international trip was in Thailand with two friends who were a couple. The nights I had the most fun were the nights they wanted couples alone time. I went out solo and met so many cool people and had the best time. I decided I was going to go to Europe a few months later I was unemployed by choice and had saved a bunch of money before I quit. On my first solo trip, I landed in Berlin, Germany. I hadnt slept much on the night flight from Canada. I remember getting out of the plane and seeing all the German signs. I had been to Thailand and saw signs in Thai. They were a culture shock, but their writing is hard to distinguish as an English speaker. I never really bothered with trying to understand Thai signs. Landing in Germany was different. I recognized the letters but had no idea what the words meant. The words were huge. For some reason, it kind of made me more nervous. The airport was crazy and I finally got to a cab. My taxi driver didnt speak any English. I hadnt spoken to any other Germans at this point, so I didnt realize that most people in Germany do know basic English. I was in the back seat thinking, Oh God, did I bite off more than I can chew ? We started driving and he turned on the radio. One of my favorite songs started playing. This song isnt popular. I had never heard it played on the radio before. I had never even met another person who knew this song, lol. We started driving into the city, and the song pumped me up. All my nervousness went away. I got out into my hostel and saw English signs. The person at the front desk spoke in German and then switched to English with ease. I ended up having so much fun that I went back to Berlin at the end of the same trip weeks later. I love Germany and am learning the language now. Its kind of a silly story, but its one Ill never forget., Istanbul is my fav city in the entire world. I loved it more than Amsterdam, Barcelona and London. Perfect mix of the east and west, clean, hospitable people, incredibly inexpensive I live in San Francisco, and amazing food. I wasnt expecting much but my word, it blew me away., We did a NYC trip and decided to add in Washington DC for days. Not a long stay, and I wasnt expecting much, but I absolutely loved my time there. Also went to Georgetown for an afternoon and its still by far one of the cutest neighbourhoods Ive ever been to., Had an absolutely brilliant time in Morocco as a solo female traveller!, Plovdiv in Bulgaria. Its the perfect blend of interesting historical places, great food and nightlife. We mostly went to Bulgaria because we were on a budget, but it turned out to be one of the best trips Ive had in years. Also the nature in Bulgaria is mesmerizing., Was taking a taxi from Quebec City airport into old town. The driver didnt speak great English but when we told him where we were staying and how many days we had he made some suggestions that were useful. Rather than just hang in QC, he suggested renting a car and going towards Saquenay etc and hitting the small towns along the way., I love this. I LOVE Turkey.\n",
            "Milan is fine but nothing overly special. A day or two to see the Duomo and other sights is worth it, but days would be overkill for most people. Maybe the fashion and clubbing will keep your friend happy the whole time, not something I am overly familiar with myself., Milan is absolutely decent, but it depends what youre into yourself. I think its reputation in this subreddit stems from comparisons to more historical cities architecture wise, however there is absolutely quite a bit to do. Also, its an actually living and economically well off city rather than a tourist Disneyland like what e.g. Venice is and what others like Florence are slowly becoming unfortunately. As a result, its quite a bit more Italian in an everyday life sense. Rome for instance is absolutely top notch in almost all ways, but once youre out and about exploring the centre most people youll be bumping into will be American families and German backpackers, while itll be Italian students and businesspeople in Milan. Apart from Pinacoteca Brera, which in itself is a great museum, you have quite a lot of technology and military focused museums, you have the Sforzesco castle bang in the middle, some interesting modern architecture green skyscrapers as well as the canals with a bustling nightlife. Food is good do some research on typical Lombard and Milanese dishes and youll have a blast, plus due to the fact that you always had a lot of migration from all parts of Italy to Milan it also offers any sort of Italian regional cuisine that you can imagine, from Abruzzo to le Marche. Its also rather safe and walkable. Onceif you do get enough of it the Alps are close, as are many other midsized Italian cities given Italys good high speed train network Verona, Parma, Modena, Bologna all about h away or less., Yes, its a commercial city. Its still nice to visit, but you dont need days. I live just over an hour away across the border, and only visit Milan for the airport and to buy clothes. When I go clubbing with friends we usually take the train to Torino and stay there for the weekend., I was in Milan last year for days around Christmas. It was nice. The cathedral, Christmas village and last supper were great. Day trip or overnight to lake como would be nice., Take the train from Milan and do daytrips. LuganoSwitzerland for example, also if you have a tight budget its much harder to enjoy yourselves, It was fine. To us it was very commercial. We didnt have any bad incidents but we felt it was a city that could be seen almost entirely in days. We always felt safe but we stayed pretty much in the downtown area. I havent been to other cities in Italy so I cant compare though, The towns around Milano are awesome Bergamo Lecco Etc Can always stay in Milan and day trip, I really like it. I was surprised by how many renaissance artworks the multiple museums have and we also love the fine dining aspect of it. Oh make sure you bring your friend to the fashion street and contemporary art museum. My favorite is Ambrosian Library and Brera. I spent half day on each and could easily spent more. So much to see. Francesco Messina museum is another one of my favorite. Duomo is just okayish for me in comparison. La Rosa, Seta and LAlchimia left us some memorable experience when it comes to fine dining. In short I guess it just worked so perfectly for us because after a long day of browsing museum we can just pop into a nice restaurant for a bottle of wine and cap the night with a negroni at some chill bar talking about that piece of art that kept us in awe., Do some day trips? I really loved lake Como., Milan is a business city. You can easily see it all in a day or two. You should be spending more time in cities like Florence and Siena., Milan, beside beibg the fashion capital of Italy, clubbing etc has a huge amount of museums and other cultural sites. Who says youll cover Milan on one day does not know what is talking about. In one day youll just cover Sforzas Castle. Do your researches, there are plenty of cultral sites to see., I didnt like it much when I was there days is way to long, I spent days in Milan and wish I could have spent an extra day albeit it not at the expense of anywhere else we went Its not on my hall of fame city list but its worth visiting for a few days before going onto Lake Como, Verona, etc., there are great museums in milan! especially the novacento and the pinacoteca di brera. i also prefer historical sights to fashion and clubbing but i enjoyed milan. there were even museums that i couldnt go to bc i didnt have enough time. also you can take day trips out of milan, we went to pavia which was super pretty, I dont know, I didnt mind it, food was good, public transportation was easy, and honestly it doesnt matter just make use of the train system. If youre staying in Milan you can hop a train to Lake Como, Verona, like any number of nearby towns and cities. Really quick and not particularly expensive. If you get bored of Milan, day trip somewhere else., If you like spas, there is an excellent and very reasonably priced spa called QC Terme in the centre. You can easily spend a whole day there. You can also take the train to the beautiful Lake Como., Personally I think its a very grande and majestic city. Its one of the fashion capitals of the world and theres a certain elegance to the general atmosphere. Perhaps thats not your vibe, but I liked it. I feel like a superstar walking down Via Monte Napoleone and the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is supposed to be magical at Christmas time. You could do a day trip to the Lake Como area if you want to break up your time there., Visit Como andor Bergamo. Not very far, One cool thing to see in Milan is the old cemetery because its like an open museum with tons of beautiful monuments and tombs.\n",
            "One thing I really like to do is sit on a public bench on a busy street and just observe. Not doing anything, just being there. At moments like that I feel that I am truly privileged to keep doing this., I was working up in North Queensland, on a day off we went Barramundi fishing in croc country, the stuff dreams are made of. One of blokes we were with was just sitting down on his phone the whole time not fishing or anything and was watching videos on Instagram. I had a look over his shoulder to see what he was watching and he was watching videos of people Barramundi fishing. Its very common these days for some unknown reason to prefer watching someone else having fun than actually have fun yourself., I usually like to read up on what or where Im visiting to help with taking in the whole experience. I read about it as I sitstand there. It enriches the experience by helping me visualize what happened in that location or in the creation of it., As youve just discovered being present requires time so the experience can sink in. That happens to me when I have a chance to be somewhere long enough. Its not always possible. Ive been to Machu Picchu and consider it one of the most amazing places Ive visited but for obvious technical reasons did not have time to fully absorb its majesty. But Ive also had a chance to stay in Belmond hotel in Iguazu and that has completely changed the experience of admiring the waterfalls. If I can stay in one place for a while being in the moment just happens. Im in Buenos Aires rn and will be here for about a month total, thats very different than hitting all the attractions in days and moving on., I was just in Ayutthaya,Thailand. Although Im sure other people lived there before this, it was originally settled and given a name by the Khmer people around AD, and became the second capital of Siam in , and was renamed. It was captured by the Burmese in , and then sacked in . Obviously, theres more to it than that. But, knowing some of the history of what Im seeing is helpful in my ability to truly appreciate the significance, and to see it more clearly. However, while there, I noticed that the majority of people were just taking quick pictures and selfies with the ruins, and then rushing off to the next spot. Now, to be clear, I dont care how others spend their time. But its still something that I notice. Also, Im quite sure Ive done the same, or similar, during my travels. I know I can have moments of mindlessness, just like anyone else. So, I can understand what youre saying. But I also just choose to try to do some research before visiting a location, and try to understand its significance in both a global perspective at the time of its greatest useactivity, and how its existence has shaped history up to the current age. Then again, sometimes I dont want to be overly analytical, and just enjoy seeing something cool, with a little bit of understanding about it., Definitely through drawingsketching. It requires a physical and mental pause plus deep noticing. Even if the drawing turns out awful sometimes they do its still a nice moment., In , I went to the est places I could find, tallest building in Dubai, oldest pub in Ireland, oldest house in London, etc. I am so glad I took videos of them all. I enjoy viewing them again once in a while. Even have them all in my YouTube. Totallyh worth it., I tend to take a lot of photos of places albeit now not as many as when I first started travelling but I think sometimes just loving the places I am visiting has helped me be present. I love history and so I try to visit the sites that interest me as well as museums. And when I visit museums, I try to actually read the little bits of information. Has that resulted in me spending literal hours in museums? Yes, but i love it., I bought a point and shoot digital camera and leave my phone off in the bag in case of emergency. Keeps me off my phone and its fun to use a camera. Need directions, ask a local. Spark up conversation. Looking for a place to eat, look for a local, ask them. They might even go with you or say go here and tell them I sent you. Ive also done this with a partner or friend that Im traveling with. Today, you are the navigator and phone person. Im leaving mine in the room. Then the next day, you take phone responsibilities. Youll find by the end, both of you are on your phones way less and neither wants the phone responsibilities. Also the times where your both on your phones go away and the phone person feels bad being on their phone around you., Went to Alhambra, the architecture was breathtaking. I took pictures too. But for me it was to think about what was this place like for the people who were there. Alhambra was the palace for sultans ruling Granada for centuries. Someone was born there, got married there, had kids there, and died there. I imagine their life moments as they happened. I was standing in the same place as they did but the only dimension different was time. We dont know yet how to go back on time dimension and time can only travel forward, but history brought their time to me. Thats how I do it, I kind of had the same realisation when looking at David. Technically the whole of Galleria dell Accademia can be done in a few minutes. But I was listening to Rick Steves audio guide and that helped me appreciate the sculpture way better. I stayed near David for some time after the guide ended. Imagining it at the top of the red Dome. Imagining the Dome itself being built. I felt transported to a time long long ago., Over the years I have taken out my phone less and less as I travel to be in the moment of what Im experiencing or witnessing! I dont find myself flicking through photos to relive a moment and its very rare I ever pull out my phone to show someone one of the rare instances I did take a picture. I talk about it how it was, what it looked like, how it felt and I think people get more of a sense of how great or bad or scary or crazy an experience was vs looking at a static photo! As Im discussing everything Im reliving all of it and not missing bits and pieces because I was more concerned with taking the perfect picture! If someone asks me a questions I can usually answer it and now I have fun library of trivia I can throw at people because I was more focused on listening or doing or being than clicking a button for a photo that Im probably going to later question was this Arizona or Nevada because they were almost identical photowise. I was at the tea farm in South Carolina and people were literally taking photos of the little plastic pots of dirt instead of listening to the tour guide! Dirt!! I laughed because all I could think about is if they did go back and look at them or show someone what would they say!? Oh ya, they grow tea in dirt I have a European trip coming up in about . months and Im going to do exactly what Ive been doing, live in the moment with my phone in my pocket and when we are just hanging out with nothing better to do, I make snap a photo or two of US with a fun background and then put it right back!, The number of times Ive been told I only need the time Ive allocated to a destination is many more times than the actual number of destinations Ive visited lol. Taking it a bit slower Id never a bad thing and leaves tons of opportunities to just be. You never have to rush through attractions to keep on schedule could even take in a second visit if it was desired, plus you have time to see and do things that are likely as good but are free of the crowds that concentrate on the super famous spots. No phones at restaurants has also been a great rule because it allows for the opportunity to just be a fly on the wall., Along with sitting down and observing life at a slower pace, I utilise all my senses to create a happy place memory at somewhere I find relaxing. I think to myself what am I hearing? Waves, birds, music?, what are the aromas? Food, coffee, fragrance? Touch, is the sun warming my skin, are my feet dipped in the sea? Building the complete rounded memory which you can return to whenever you choose., I also have a deep contempt for the checklist travelers that lives somewhere between pity and disgust. To me its so much better to plan your days agenda in broad concepts, and then let your observations and mood dictate what you do and what direction you go., Everyone travels differently obviously, but Ive always been the type to soak in the place Im visiting. When I travel somewhere I like ticking off a few things off my bucket list but I also leave a lot of time to just enjoy the city. For example I recently went to Bali but didnt do many of the main attractions there. I stayed in a local area and enjoyed time with locals, visiting local temples and so on. Yeah my Instagram is not perfect but does it need to be?, One of my favorite travel moments was visiting Maiden Castle. Otherwise hardly known to be an eventful attraction, it was so special. I had really wanted to visit it, but the only way I could required walking from the station at Dorchester miles away doable, but hardly an exciting walk I thought. It turned out having to walk made is so much more magical. Looking out across the land with the farms and fields and then seeing the massive mound that is Maiden Castle directly ahead come into view was amazing. It was like I was a Roman soldier, sans sword and sandals. One of untold numbers who have come to this place for millennia. You could practically feel the ancient site. That set the mood just right for exploring the site itself. Wandering up, down, and around it, it is hard to describe, but I somehow became totally engrossed by it. You could feel the place, from understanding the odd geographic authority of the place to lives long forgotten who have done the same. The only other visitors were sheep, birds, and a fox., I hiked with my family to The Wave in Arizona. Its a petrified sand dune. Think of it as an undulating sandstone formation with bands of bright color. You can google it for a better idea. The government grants a handful of passes to visit each day and hiking to it is miles one way through desert. In some places you hike over slickrock and the trails are not well marked. But once you get there, its very peaceful. With few people there, you can really take your time and drink it in. I watched some groups stay for minutes and leave. But we spent hours watching the light play across the sandstone and just being there, reflecting on what it was like to have the place nearly to ourselves. I like to do this thing I call saving up a moment I can live inside forever. Ill try to take an impression about everything in that moment. The way the wind sounds, how the sun feels on my skin. What I see as I sit there. How it makes me feel. Taking mental pictures. Now when I want to feel that sense of peace, I shut my eyes and put myself back in that place, sitting on the crest of a sand dune wave. It was a once in a lifetime thing, but its not just some thing I once did. I carry it with me., Same. In all my travels I like to buy some food and then sit on a bench in a busy street or monument. It really gives you time to realize you are there and reflect on how you got and that point in life. Also, it makes you appreciate local food better., I have a friend that I go on city breaks with a lot. One of our favourite things to do is sit down outside a bar in a busy area and just look around us at the architecture, the scenery, and the people and just soak it all in. We invited a friend on one of our trips this year, and she could not get on board with it at all. She felt that any time not in a museum or art gallery was wasted time.\n"

        "To create your retriever, you need to use an encoder model. Something like BERT? Nah, BERT is so yesterday. Find something new and shiny! ✨ The basic idea is to encode every document (sentence) in your corpus into a vector space using the same encoder. Then, encode the user query into that same space. With some similarity metrics like dot product, you can find the most similar document to the user’s input and retrieve it. 🎯 You can train your own encoder if you have enough data and resources, 💪 or you can use one of those [ready-made on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=sentence-similarity&sort=trending), like these ones."

            "Retrieved: Depends on where and when youre going. Paris in spring? Book months out or more Porto in July? Good luck, should have booked last year. Most of Cental America? Just wait until youre on the way., I try to know where Im going at least months in advance. Right now, I have my plan sorted all the way to things can obviously still change tho, so generally I book or months in advance. For example, Ill be staying in Japan in late November, but Im booking the place maybe with AirBnB... maybe not in early July., I have things booked until late November this year and I am about to start looking for December. Summer in Europe I always have booked by February, if not earlier., deleted, Ive booked a few days ahead and had no problems. Some cities like Istanbul have so many places that the prices will be the same, even at the last minute. Look into the supply and demand of Airbnbs in your location., I usually have everything booked months into the future. Currently I have all my flights and Airbnbs booked till the end of October., As soon as we buy the airplane tickets., Months ahead if possible, The best time to book is months out. The second best is less than one week., weeks normally., Usually when Im at the airport waiting to fly to my destination. I like the spontaneous nature of adventure. Its always worked out. I rarely get an Airbnb for more than a few days then discuss a more long term stay after Ive been there a while and figured out the space worked for me., The day before, At the beginning and height of the pandemic, it was hard to plan too far ahead things changed so often! I rarely booked more than months in advance. By contrast, right now Im booked into November. But planning too far ahead cuts you off from lastminute opportunities that may arise on sites like Trusted Housesitters. Im going to try to keep my schedule more open for that reason., As soon as I know for sure I will be there. However, I often dont know what Im going to do until a few days to a week before, as I update my plans based on new information. If theres a big event going on that I want to attend, I usually book more like weeks in advance., Normally months in advance. Ive been in Japan and Korea now though, and for them I needed to book months in advance. But I go for pretty low prices, so I want to be early to get the best ones, I get a hotel bc fuck airbnb, months, I try completely avoid AirBnB. It is one of those corporations that only cares about profit with no regard for the communities they operate in., Im currently booked through February , and plan to start booking the next round in September. So roughly six to nine months out., Usually a month or two ahead, no matter what. I always book for a month long stay, and of the time stay below mo Latin America, previously southwestern Europe as well, before prices went crazy. I just counted all my stays vs cancels since when I joined. Kind of ashamed at my numbers. stays and cancels mine, not the hosts. Luckily all my reviews are very positive. Glad I got refunded on most of those cancelations. I probably throw away per year on canceled reservations when plans change and another lost on flights. I just cant book far out cause I frequently change my mind, so month to month is better. (Score: 0.46192750334739685)\n",

I just did a search for nonstop flights from my local airport during a random week in August as a test, and a big map came up that shows me that I could go to Anchorage for , Dubai for , Lisbon for , or Montreal for . So you could probably find all sorts of options that way? There are lots of filters if you have a particular distance, price, number of stops, etc. in mind., Beaches, culture, museums, food, and the occasional mountain? Go to Spain. Its also a very hospitable country with great tourism infrastructure so good for a firsttime solo traveller., I tried that dart thing once!! Spent two weeks vacationing behind my refrigerator. , I have a half dozen trips on the list. The way I narrow it down for what is next is Compelling Event Is there some event museum exhibit, concert, theater, etc or seasonal event that necessitates putting that location higher up on the list or doing it asap. This can also be as simple as I have PTO I have to use at X time, what on my list is better to travel then? But also sometimes Is the offseason for this place safe aka not in Hurrican season and so is just shitty weather? Are my planned interestsactivities weather dependent? I then look at limiting factors Time How much time do I have off, and which destinations would be a good fit for that timerange. Ive got some dream ish week trips, and a few week trips, and a few week long or weekend long trips in my mind. BudgetMoney Which on the list can I afford to do? Which might be cheaper to do now? Does one place on the list have cheaper flights, hotels, etc? Other factors Such as which ones can I do solo? From here I may have a list of a few options. Ill do more research and then decide from that. Sometimes there is an internal theme Im wanting to do. Maybe Im burnt out at work and want a more relaxing tropical vacation. Maybe Im hungering for adventure. Maybe I want to splurge on luxury, or maybe I want to indulge the child in me who wanted to be Indiana Jones or a museum curator and go with something museumancient history oriented. Im now in a place where I can splurge so lately Ive been doing the What the hell LETS GO BIG and doing the top dream trip from the list., My husband and I wanted to go somewhere and we didnt know where, so we literally looked up the furthest nonstop flight from our preferred airline and, well, we leave for Seoul tomorrow!, Its a great way to find out where you dont want to go, For your first ever trip, Id recommend something like EnglandScotlandIreland. Itll get you used to being in a foreign country, get your travel legs under you, and everyone still speaks English so you wont have any issues getting help if you run into trouble. After that, the world is your oyster I started with England and was very glad that I did, cause I was able to use what Id learned about travelling when we went to more difficult places like Peru!, Not a dart but Ive put lots of destinations in a hat and drew one before., I think the random thing is a bad move, at least for my style. I dont want to trust my hard earned travel dollars up to chance. Theres no upside to doing that. Id suggest to break out of the indecision by simply pulling the trigger on the most popular budget backpacker destination on the planet SE Asia. Its the perfect choice for an indecisive, nervous first timer. Its safe, inexpensive and has excellent tourist infrastructure. Its completely foreign, but not intimidating. Its the perfect place to learn how to travel. Good luck no matter what you decide. Happy travels., Its not throwing a dart, but I do pick dates and then use google flight map and go where the cheapest flight is., Imo Japan would be great for solo travel but I am biased since I did my first solo there , If this is your first trip, go to Europe, maybe Spain or France. UK or Ireland are good too. The reason is that they are easy places to get around, mostly safe, the water is clean so you wont get sick, and not much of a language barrier as you will find lots of people who speak English. You can stay at hostels save a lot of money and meet people too. You will make mistakes but not much will happen to you, maybe miss a train, etc. Stuff you can solve with a little money. You will learn a lot and be more comfortable traveling by yourself. I also find that traveling in Europe tends to be much cheaper than traveling in the US and way more exciting. Depending on how much time and money you have you could also do several countries. Buy a ticket, say, to Madrid and get your return ticket out of maybe Amsterdam. Then your adventure is the journey from Madrid to Amsterdam. Or into Paris and out of London, etc. You get the idea. Good luck!, Picking a random place is a terrible idea for a starter trip. If youre starting traveling then focus on reducing some of the friction so youll want a place where you can get by with the languages you already speak, relatively low crime, available hotels, functioning bank system, etc. Im all for going to riskierout of the way type places, but get some experience first, just so you can deal with the issues that arise. From the west coast of the US, Id suggest Japan as an ideal starter holiday. Youll get to explore a very different culture, but in a country that functions smoothly enough that no issues will be particularly difficult to solve. Plus it ticks your boxes. Maybe iffy on beaches, but for the rest of them., I dont throw a dart at a map, but my selection process could potentially be just as random. I set prices for parts of the world say for Europe, for Caribbean, for Hawaii and so on. Then when one of my alerts trips I check it out. If the details are not terrible long layovers etc I book it. Usually this takes less than an hour, sometimes these flight deals disappear fast. Once I have the flights I start looking at lodging and then finally activities. This often means that Im traveling off season but I like skipping the crowds anyway and a little cold or rain never bothered me much. My default is days. Not sure why I picked as the trips usually start mid week, so Im typically not even taking advantage of two weekends. Thats just when the flights are usually cheap. If Im going somewhere anything less than days just feels like its not worth the effort. Lately Ive been watching travel zoo as they have a bunch of all inclusive type packages for destinations in Europe and Asia. I found a trip to Portugal there that was run out of a travel agency in Spain. It was really economical, something like for days including flights and hotel and a tour bus and guide and admission to sites. Id probably do something like that again, I could probably do it myself for a little cheaper, but it was nice not having to drive or decide what to do or where to go or figure out parking in a rental car., Croatia!, Given how shitty I am at darts Id hit something like Syria or South Sudan and end up in big trouble., South east Asia.

Safetys good if youre not wandering around after dark a precaution Id take in most African countries anyway. Public transport is cramped and distances are long, but the process is fairly easy. In general, I found it possible to travel cheaply across both West and East Africa, even with safaris. I took public transport throughout.

Stay safe and have fun ., Hello, I just got back from Egypt a couple weeks ago. While it wasnt the worst city I have been to, there are some unfortunate realities that all parties going on the trip should be aware of. Ive visited just over countries across Africa, Asia and Europe and Egypt is unique. Its a place you go to see the pyramids and widen your worldview. Its not a vacation destination. When I arrived at CAI was detained in the airport for no reason other than being an American. They held me and my passport for nearly two hours without cause. I have heard this happening to many other Americans so just be aware. What everyone else is saying about how your daughters will be treated is true. If they are attractive, white, western, women they will be verbally and physically harassed. Its unfortunate but a reality. They should dress modestly, loose fitting, higher neckline clothing and be aware of how to deal with harassment. When I visited the pyramids a sewer line busted over the road so a literal river of shit was flowing and a horse died next to the road due to neglect. I had a friend who was a guide and even with a local, the merchants and scammer harassment is constant. It was not a great experience. The pyramids and sphinx are cool, but their awesomeness was diminished by the surrounding circumstances. The National museum is interesting but its in the middle of the city and traffic can be a nightmare, like literally hours to get across the city, in degree Fahrenheit heat. Its also surrounded by heavily armed guards and if youre not used to AKs and shotguns, it can feel dangerous. It can kill the feeling of a vacation. If you find Egyptian history absolutely fascinating you will find it enjoyable, if you are averagely interested in mummys, its ok. Most of my travel is solo and I really try to explore the cities I visit . Please dont do this in Cairo. You will be relentlessly followed, harassed, scammed, accosted and groped, endlessly. Im not kidding. I am a father and after returning from my visit to Cairo, I cant imagine bringing my daughter, sister, mother or wife with me. And all of them are tough, traveled, women. Unfortunately I think the only real way to enjoy Cairo as a family is to book a tour, an all inclusive one. They are expensive and annoying but they do provide a known product. They take care of the driving, the tickets, accommodations, everything. In a city like Cairo where EVERYONE is desperate for dollars or pounds, its best to stick with a crowd. I think a visit to Egypt can still be a good experience if it is approached in the right mindset. Cairo is not a place for a relaxing vacation, if you go with the intention of learning about history, experiencing the good and bad of other cultures and gaining a greater understanding of global issues, it can be a beneficial trip. If you visit Cairo hoping for a vacation where you can relax, be leisurely, and just have a nice time, I think you will be disappointed and stressed. Best of luck!, My partners family lives in Cairo so we visit each year. Heres my two cents about the city as a white American First and foremost its absolutely worth the visit. The pyramids and the museums are incredible, must visit. Now will you be harassed? Im going to assume youre nonArab and so yes, to buy goods and services, it will be constant in any tourist areas and it can be extremely uncomfortable. Many will be very shady with their pricing as well. You must be stern in negotiating and you must learn how to walk away even if you feel like youre being rude. Sometimes they may get upset and mumble something in Arabic but so be it. Some advice I recommend you remember the phrase net, spasibo. Its Russian for no thank you. Why? Egyptian street merchants are famously multilingual in common phrases and they will not take no for an answer. Its tiring. They know English, French, Spanish and German typically. But one language they dont seem to know any of is Russian. Instead of saying no and being followed for minutes with a man haggling me for something I never expressed any interest in, I say net, spasibo a few times and they walk away frustrated over the perceived language barrier. Never take a camel or carriage ride at the pyramids. For one of the animals are being poorly treated. If you must take a ride negotiate upfront not only the pricing but where exactly youll be going. They will get you on the animal or carriage, and mid way through your journey try to convince you that you need to go to some remote viewing area for the best photos. If youre not careful they will charge way more for letting them. Same applies to tour guides that approach you in the tourist areas. If you find you really want one, get the pricing up front and make sure youre firm about it. Do not let them talk you into extras without specifying what will be their charge. Never accept a simple for you I make good deal dont worry and go on your way. Get the exact amount in poundsdollarseuros. If someone offers to take your photo, its almost guaranteed they want a tip. And Ive even witnessed them refuse to give the phonecamera back until you do tip. Do not buy souvenirs from the pyramids street vendors or local shops. They will charge you way more than if you go to say Khan elKhalili for the same souvenirs. This bazaar is also super touristy but at least the people here are more willing to negotiate pricing. I try to avoid cabs at all costs. They may change the pricing on you even if you agree to a price upfront. And many cab drivers are just Egyptian men with their personal vehicles trying to make money and theres zero accountability if something goes wrong. Uber in Egypt is wonderful and dirt cheap. You can go from one side of Cairo its massive to the other for less than with Uber. Now specifically will the women youre traveling with be harassed? Very likely in the tourist areas. My partner and I are both women. We dress modestly and I recommend they do so as well. Try to avoid tight fitting clothing for example. If they dont theyre likely going to be leered at by horny teenagers and young men. Even dressed modestly we still get unsolicited joking marriage proposals and we have even had a man tell us hed murder his wife for the chance to marry my partner I constantly see these boys and men checking us out. With all of this said, I still love Cairo and I think its worth the visit. Excluding most merchants at tourist destinations, the Egyptian people are incredibly kind and hospitable. Theyre eager to interact with you and share their culture. Theyre a fiercely proud people. As for the merchants, even theyre not bad people, theyre opportunists trying to make ends meet. Edit also consider booking a VIP hotel transfer service from the airport. It can be a little pricy but Cairo airport and customs can be overwhelming your first time. With this service a local will meet you before customs and theyll help you get through. Sometimes there is a long line and you may even be able to bypass it with the assistance of the local. It will help avoid any drama with officials as well. Then theyll drive you to your hotel and you dont have to worry about the cab drivers who will rip you off exceedingly at the airport. if anyone needs Cairo travel advice feel free to reach out and Ill do my best to help! If I dont know the answer, Ill be happy to ask our family in Cairo for their advice , Been there twice. First time on the ground. Wouldnt do that again. The harassment is overwhelming. They dont take no for an answer. Second time we did a Nile cruise, which is absolutely the way to go. Safer, cleaner, fewer scams, less harassment, easier to see more sites. All cruise lines are owned by Egyptbased companies and all are similar size fairly small. Worth it to spend more for a higher end line. Having done this, if we ever go back, wed do cruise again. Be sure to do the Cairo museum. If able, cruising all the way south to see Abu Simbel is pretty epic., One of my friends went to Egypt about months ago and said that was the only place that she ever felt in danger all the time as a woman. She got separated from her group and was groped and accosted by random men. She will never go again, this is from a world traveler., Was in Cairo a few days ago, on my way to East Africa. I didnt really enjoy Cairo. Pros very unique and different. Bustling streets, lots going on. If youre a westerner its cool to see how different life is. Cons the people for the most part are unbearable. Extremely aggressive Ive been to many different countries and cities, Cairo was the worst. They dont take no for an answer. They touch you and try to block your way. Theyre constantly trying to scam you. The animals are treated so poorly, its difficult to see. The pyramids are cool enough, but its way too touristy. The streets are filthy and rundown. That being said, Ive heard great things about other Egyptian cities Aswan, Alexandria. Im also generalizing, as Im sure there are lots of polite and well meaning people in Cairo, I just didnt meet them. It also doesnt help that the contrast between Cairo and people in Tanzania is so sharp. Tanzanians are the most friendly and helpful people Ive met., Dont go anywhere without a guide. Tell the guide that you dont want to go to off the track carpetperfume papyrus places even if its free. They are overpriced and the guide gets a cut from what you buy. Go to the big market cant remember the name now but things are much cheaper there. But you will also need a guide., Male here. Been around the world more or less. Went to Egypt with female friends, worst thing they have experienced and I have seen. Havent been back and dont recommend anyone. A pity really as the history is mindblowing! Just to bad the male culture sucks., Seems accurate. Expect creepy old men to offer to buy your daughters in various livestock. Certainly never let them go anywhere individually. Fly to Luxor, it is the capital for most of ancient Egypt history, so where more of the cool stuff is. The hawkers will still be absurdly agressive. And everyone will try and rip you off. But at least you get to look at cool stuff., Well taking this one off my bucket list after reading all this depressing shit, Hire a guide. They will manage the people harassing you and help you know what to avoid. My guide would warn mewhen we go to the bathrooms there will be people on both sides, keep walking and dont make eye contact, Ill wait for you right outside the door. It made me feel safe and ensured I wasnt ever in a bad situation. Also prepare the kids to dress modestly. Its hot and they may want short shorts and a crop top its not appropriate in Egypt and its going to give your family unwanted attention., Get a guide. Best Cairo investment you can make., I absolutely loathed Cairo. If youre doing a tour Egypt, you should allow for a day to see the pyramids and museums, they are genuinely worth visiting, but the city itself is an ugly concrete jungle. We had a nice female tour guide for the pyramids and she said the old finance company she used to work for would send people to Cairo for meetings etc as punishment. Luxor and Aswan are breathtaking though, It is absolutely not worth exploring Cairo. Its a dump. My wife and I just got back from there. You cant walk feet without getting hassled. If you havent planned this already, use one of those free days in Cairo and take a day trip to Alexandria. Its six hours in a car round trip but the time you spend in the city is well worth it. It was one of my favorite parts of Egypt. Sphinx, Great Pyramids, museums all great. Make sure you get tickets to both the Egyptian museum and the civilization museum. One has all the mummies and that was awesome to walk through. Your daughters are probably going to have the worst of it. Please ask them to dress as conservatively as possible or theyre going to have a bad time. Hell, my wife was wearing my clothes while we were in Cairo because the airline lost her luggage, and she was still getting stared down and targeted pretty hard., The best thing about Cairo is leaving it. On the bright side, the trauma bonding will bring your family closer , My family did this exact itinerary more than a decade ago but still. Cairo was the worst part of our trip. I would cut it shorter if you can. We added on a few days in Hurghada for scuba if that is your cup of tea., The pyramids were very cool and it was worth it for me female, traveling with my husband and children but I hated Cairo otherwise. Ive traveled solo through India and Bangladesh and i did not feel okay leaving the apartment in Cairo without my husband. And even with my husband, nonstop harassment for me and my children. And the air quality is awful. I have asthma and couldnt breathe the whole time. Still, however, unbelievable to see such well preserved ancient history, i think it was worth it but Id never go back., Was in Cairo in my s. Got incessantly harassed. Learned that you cant walk with grocery bags in your hands as men take it as an opportunity to grab your crotch or breasts while your arms are full. Was groped at the pyramids by a police officer. Told the management of my hotel that I had been harassed by a police man and they were very kind, sat me down with a cup of tea and empathized but said there is no point reporting it to anyone as nothing would be done.

For dinners out and some fancy stuff I just packed a button down shirt, paired with black stretchy jeans and it was more than ok!

Summer in Europe I always have booked by February, if not earlier., deleted, Ive booked a few days ahead and had no problems. Some cities like Istanbul have so many places that the prices will be the same, even at the last minute. Look into the supply and demand of Airbnbs in your location., I usually have everything booked months into the future. Currently I have all my flights and Airbnbs booked till the end of October., As soon as we buy the airplane tickets., Months ahead if possible, The best time to book is months out. The second best is less than one week., weeks normally., Usually when Im at the airport waiting to fly to my destination. I like the spontaneous nature of adventure. Its always worked out. I rarely get an Airbnb for more than a few days then discuss a more long term stay after Ive been there a while and figured out the space worked for me., The day before, At the beginning and height of the pandemic, it was hard to plan too far ahead things changed so often! I rarely booked more than months in advance. By contrast, right now Im booked into November. But planning too far ahead cuts you off from lastminute opportunities that may arise on sites like Trusted Housesitters. Im going to try to keep my schedule more open for that reason., As soon as I know for sure I will be there. However, I often dont know what Im going to do until a few days to a week before, as I update my plans based on new information. If theres a big event going on that I want to attend, I usually book more like weeks in advance., Normally months in advance. Ive been in Japan and Korea now though, and for them I needed to book months in advance. But I go for pretty low prices, so I want to be early to get the best ones, I get a hotel bc fuck airbnb, months, I try completely avoid AirBnB. It is one of those corporations that only cares about profit with no regard for the communities they operate in., Im currently booked through February , and plan to start booking the next round in September. So roughly six to nine months out., Usually a month or two ahead, no matter what. I always book for a month long stay, and of the time stay below mo Latin America, previously southwestern Europe as well, before prices went crazy. I just counted all my stays vs cancels since when I joined. Kind of ashamed at my numbers. stays and cancels mine, not the hosts. Luckily all my reviews are very positive. Glad I got refunded on most of those cancelations. I probably throw away per year on canceled reservations when plans change and another lost on flights. I just cant book far out cause I frequently change my mind, so month to month is better. (Score: 0.46192750334739685)\n",

I just did a search for nonstop flights from my local airport during a random week in August as a test, and a big map came up that shows me that I could go to Anchorage for , Dubai for , Lisbon for , or Montreal for . So you could probably find all sorts of options that way? There are lots of filters if you have a particular distance, price, number of stops, etc. in mind., Beaches, culture, museums, food, and the occasional mountain? Go to Spain. Its also a very hospitable country with great tourism infrastructure so good for a firsttime solo traveller., I tried that dart thing once!! Spent two weeks vacationing behind my refrigerator. , I have a half dozen trips on the list. The way I narrow it down for what is next is Compelling Event Is there some event museum exhibit, concert, theater, etc or seasonal event that necessitates putting that location higher up on the list or doing it asap. This can also be as simple as I have PTO I have to use at X time, what on my list is better to travel then? But also sometimes Is the offseason for this place safe aka not in Hurrican season and so is just shitty weather? Are my planned interestsactivities weather dependent? I then look at limiting factors Time How much time do I have off, and which destinations would be a good fit for that timerange. Ive got some dream ish week trips, and a few week trips, and a few week long or weekend long trips in my mind. BudgetMoney Which on the list can I afford to do? Which might be cheaper to do now? Does one place on the list have cheaper flights, hotels, etc? Other factors Such as which ones can I do solo? From here I may have a list of a few options. Ill do more research and then decide from that. Sometimes there is an internal theme Im wanting to do. Maybe Im burnt out at work and want a more relaxing tropical vacation. Maybe Im hungering for adventure. Maybe I want to splurge on luxury, or maybe I want to indulge the child in me who wanted to be Indiana Jones or a museum curator and go with something museumancient history oriented. Im now in a place where I can splurge so lately Ive been doing the What the hell LETS GO BIG and doing the top dream trip from the list., My husband and I wanted to go somewhere and we didnt know where, so we literally looked up the furthest nonstop flight from our preferred airline and, well, we leave for Seoul tomorrow!, Its a great way to find out where you dont want to go, For your first ever trip, Id recommend something like EnglandScotlandIreland. Itll get you used to being in a foreign country, get your travel legs under you, and everyone still speaks English so you wont have any issues getting help if you run into trouble. After that, the world is your oyster I started with England and was very glad that I did, cause I was able to use what Id learned about travelling when we went to more difficult places like Peru!, Not a dart but Ive put lots of destinations in a hat and drew one before., I think the random thing is a bad move, at least for my style. I dont want to trust my hard earned travel dollars up to chance. Theres no upside to doing that. Id suggest to break out of the indecision by simply pulling the trigger on the most popular budget backpacker destination on the planet SE Asia. Its the perfect choice for an indecisive, nervous first timer. Its safe, inexpensive and has excellent tourist infrastructure. Its completely foreign, but not intimidating. Its the perfect place to learn how to travel. Good luck no matter what you decide. Happy travels., Its not throwing a dart, but I do pick dates and then use google flight map and go where the cheapest flight is., Imo Japan would be great for solo travel but I am biased since I did my first solo there , If this is your first trip, go to Europe, maybe Spain or France. UK or Ireland are good too. The reason is that they are easy places to get around, mostly safe, the water is clean so you wont get sick, and not much of a language barrier as you will find lots of people who speak English. You can stay at hostels save a lot of money and meet people too. You will make mistakes but not much will happen to you, maybe miss a train, etc. Stuff you can solve with a little money. You will learn a lot and be more comfortable traveling by yourself. I also find that traveling in Europe tends to be much cheaper than traveling in the US and way more exciting. Depending on how much time and money you have you could also do several countries. Buy a ticket, say, to Madrid and get your return ticket out of maybe Amsterdam. Then your adventure is the journey from Madrid to Amsterdam. Or into Paris and out of London, etc. You get the idea. Good luck!, Picking a random place is a terrible idea for a starter trip. If youre starting traveling then focus on reducing some of the friction so youll want a place where you can get by with the languages you already speak, relatively low crime, available hotels, functioning bank system, etc. Im all for going to riskierout of the way type places, but get some experience first, just so you can deal with the issues that arise. From the west coast of the US, Id suggest Japan as an ideal starter holiday. Youll get to explore a very different culture, but in a country that functions smoothly enough that no issues will be particularly difficult to solve. Plus it ticks your boxes. Maybe iffy on beaches, but for the rest of them., I dont throw a dart at a map, but my selection process could potentially be just as random. I set prices for parts of the world say for Europe, for Caribbean, for Hawaii and so on. Then when one of my alerts trips I check it out. If the details are not terrible long layovers etc I book it. Usually this takes less than an hour, sometimes these flight deals disappear fast. Once I have the flights I start looking at lodging and then finally activities. This often means that Im traveling off season but I like skipping the crowds anyway and a little cold or rain never bothered me much. My default is days. Not sure why I picked as the trips usually start mid week, so Im typically not even taking advantage of two weekends. Thats just when the flights are usually cheap. If Im going somewhere anything less than days just feels like its not worth the effort. Lately Ive been watching travel zoo as they have a bunch of all inclusive type packages for destinations in Europe and Asia. I found a trip to Portugal there that was run out of a travel agency in Spain. It was really economical, something like for days including flights and hotel and a tour bus and guide and admission to sites.

Safetys good if youre not wandering around after dark a precaution Id take in most African countries anyway. Public transport is cramped and distances are long, but the process is fairly easy. In general, I found it possible to travel cheaply across both West and East Africa, even with safaris. I took public transport throughout. For East Africa costs, accommodation, and transport info, I relied on a lot of information from this website Tanzania safaris can be pretty cheap for what you get you just need to book with a local company once you get there. A week long camping safari can be had in the , range. Thatd include food too. Depending on where youre at, thats only slightly more than your plane ticket.

Stay safe and have fun ., Hello, I just got back from Egypt a couple weeks ago. While it wasnt the worst city I have been to, there are some unfortunate realities that all parties going on the trip should be aware of. Ive visited just over countries across Africa, Asia and Europe and Egypt is unique. Its a place you go to see the pyramids and widen your worldview. Its not a vacation destination. When I arrived at CAI was detained in the airport for no reason other than being an American. They held me and my passport for nearly two hours without cause. I have heard this happening to many other Americans so just be aware. What everyone else is saying about how your daughters will be treated is true. If they are attractive, white, western, women they will be verbally and physically harassed. Its unfortunate but a reality. They should dress modestly, loose fitting, higher neckline clothing and be aware of how to deal with harassment. When I visited the pyramids a sewer line busted over the road so a literal river of shit was flowing and a horse died next to the road due to neglect. I had a friend who was a guide and even with a local, the merchants and scammer harassment is constant. It was not a great experience. The pyramids and sphinx are cool, but their awesomeness was diminished by the surrounding circumstances. The National museum is interesting but its in the middle of the city and traffic can be a nightmare, like literally hours to get across the city, in degree Fahrenheit heat. Its also surrounded by heavily armed guards and if youre not used to AKs and shotguns, it can feel dangerous. It can kill the feeling of a vacation. If you find Egyptian history absolutely fascinating you will find it enjoyable, if you are averagely interested in mummys, its ok. Most of my travel is solo and I really try to explore the cities I visit . Please dont do this in Cairo. You will be relentlessly followed, harassed, scammed, accosted and groped, endlessly. Im not kidding. I am a father and after returning from my visit to Cairo, I cant imagine bringing my daughter, sister, mother or wife with me. And all of them are tough, traveled, women. Unfortunately I think the only real way to enjoy Cairo as a family is to book a tour, an all inclusive one. They are expensive and annoying but they do provide a known product. They take care of the driving, the tickets, accommodations, everything. In a city like Cairo where EVERYONE is desperate for dollars or pounds, its best to stick with a crowd. I think a visit to Egypt can still be a good experience if it is approached in the right mindset. Cairo is not a place for a relaxing vacation, if you go with the intention of learning about history, experiencing the good and bad of other cultures and gaining a greater understanding of global issues, it can be a beneficial trip. If you visit Cairo hoping for a vacation where you can relax, be leisurely, and just have a nice time, I think you will be disappointed and stressed. Best of luck!, My partners family lives in Cairo so we visit each year. Heres my two cents about the city as a white American First and foremost its absolutely worth the visit. The pyramids and the museums are incredible, must visit. Now will you be harassed? Im going to assume youre nonArab and so yes, to buy goods and services, it will be constant in any tourist areas and it can be extremely uncomfortable. Many will be very shady with their pricing as well. You must be stern in negotiating and you must learn how to walk away even if you feel like youre being rude. Sometimes they may get upset and mumble something in Arabic but so be it. Some advice I recommend you remember the phrase net, spasibo. Its Russian for no thank you. Why? Egyptian street merchants are famously multilingual in common phrases and they will not take no for an answer. Its tiring. They know English, French, Spanish and German typically. But one language they dont seem to know any of is Russian. Instead of saying no and being followed for minutes with a man haggling me for something I never expressed any interest in, I say net, spasibo a few times and they walk away frustrated over the perceived language barrier. Never take a camel or carriage ride at the pyramids. For one of the animals are being poorly treated. If you must take a ride negotiate upfront not only the pricing but where exactly youll be going. They will get you on the animal or carriage, and mid way through your journey try to convince you that you need to go to some remote viewing area for the best photos. If youre not careful they will charge way more for letting them. Same applies to tour guides that approach you in the tourist areas. If you find you really want one, get the pricing up front and make sure youre firm about it. Do not let them talk you into extras without specifying what will be their charge. Never accept a simple for you I make good deal dont worry and go on your way. Get the exact amount in poundsdollarseuros. If someone offers to take your photo, its almost guaranteed they want a tip. And Ive even witnessed them refuse to give the phonecamera back until you do tip. Do not buy souvenirs from the pyramids street vendors or local shops. They will charge you way more than if you go to say Khan elKhalili for the same souvenirs. This bazaar is also super touristy but at least the people here are more willing to negotiate pricing. I try to avoid cabs at all costs. They may change the pricing on you even if you agree to a price upfront. And many cab drivers are just Egyptian men with their personal vehicles trying to make money and theres zero accountability if something goes wrong. Uber in Egypt is wonderful and dirt cheap. You can go from one side of Cairo its massive to the other for less than with Uber. Now specifically will the women youre traveling with be harassed? Very likely in the tourist areas. My partner and I are both women. We dress modestly and I recommend they do so as well. Try to avoid tight fitting clothing for example. If they dont theyre likely going to be leered at by horny teenagers and young men. Even dressed modestly we still get unsolicited joking marriage proposals and we have even had a man tell us hed murder his wife for the chance to marry my partner I constantly see these boys and men checking us out. With all of this said, I still love Cairo and I think its worth the visit. Excluding most merchants at tourist destinations, the Egyptian people are incredibly kind and hospitable. Theyre eager to interact with you and share their culture. Theyre a fiercely proud people. As for the merchants, even theyre not bad people, theyre opportunists trying to make ends meet. Edit also consider booking a VIP hotel transfer service from the airport. It can be a little pricy but Cairo airport and customs can be overwhelming your first time. With this service a local will meet you before customs and theyll help you get through. Sometimes there is a long line and you may even be able to bypass it with the assistance of the local. It will help avoid any drama with officials as well. Then theyll drive you to your hotel and you dont have to worry about the cab drivers who will rip you off exceedingly at the airport. if anyone needs Cairo travel advice feel free to reach out and Ill do my best to help! If I dont know the answer, Ill be happy to ask our family in Cairo for their advice , Been there twice. First time on the ground. Wouldnt do that again. The harassment is overwhelming. They dont take no for an answer. Second time we did a Nile cruise, which is absolutely the way to go. Safer, cleaner, fewer scams, less harassment, easier to see more sites. All cruise lines are owned by Egyptbased companies and all are similar size fairly small. Worth it to spend more for a higher end line. Having done this, if we ever go back, wed do cruise again. Be sure to do the Cairo museum. If able, cruising all the way south to see Abu Simbel is pretty epic., One of my friends went to Egypt about months ago and said that was the only place that she ever felt in danger all the time as a woman. She got separated from her group and was groped and accosted by random men. She will never go again, this is from a world traveler., Was in Cairo a few days ago, on my way to East Africa. I didnt really enjoy Cairo. Pros very unique and different. Bustling streets, lots going on. If youre a westerner its cool to see how different life is. Cons the people for the most part are unbearable. Extremely aggressive Ive been to many different countries and cities, Cairo was the worst. They dont take no for an answer. They touch you and try to block your way. Theyre constantly trying to scam you. The animals are treated so poorly, its difficult to see. The pyramids are cool enough, but its way too touristy. The streets are filthy and rundown. That being said, Ive heard great things about other Egyptian cities Aswan, Alexandria. Im also generalizing, as Im sure there are lots of polite and well meaning people in Cairo, I just didnt meet them. It also doesnt help that the contrast between Cairo and people in Tanzania is so sharp. Tanzanians are the most friendly and helpful people Ive met., Dont go anywhere without a guide. Tell the guide that you dont want to go to off the track carpetperfume papyrus places even if its free. They are overpriced and the guide gets a cut from what you buy. Go to the big market cant remember the name now but things are much cheaper there. But you will also need a guide., Male here. Been around the world more or less. Went to Egypt with female friends, worst thing they have experienced and I have seen. Havent been back and dont recommend anyone. A pity really as the history is mindblowing! Just to bad the male culture sucks., Seems accurate. Expect creepy old men to offer to buy your daughters in various livestock. Certainly never let them go anywhere individually. Fly to Luxor, it is the capital for most of ancient Egypt history, so where more of the cool stuff is. The hawkers will still be absurdly agressive. And everyone will try and rip you off. But at least you get to look at cool stuff., Well taking this one off my bucket list after reading all this depressing shit, Hire a guide. They will manage the people harassing you and help you know what to avoid. My guide would warn mewhen we go to the bathrooms there will be people on both sides, keep walking and dont make eye contact, Ill wait for you right outside the door. It made me feel safe and ensured I wasnt ever in a bad situation. Also prepare the kids to dress modestly. Its hot and they may want short shorts and a crop top its not appropriate in Egypt and its going to give your family unwanted attention., Get a guide. Best Cairo investment you can make., I absolutely loathed Cairo. If youre doing a tour Egypt, you should allow for a day to see the pyramids and museums, they are genuinely worth visiting, but the city itself is an ugly concrete jungle. We had a nice female tour guide for the pyramids and she said the old finance company she used to work for would send people to Cairo for meetings etc as punishment. Luxor and Aswan are breathtaking though, It is absolutely not worth exploring Cairo. Its a dump. My wife and I just got back from there. You cant walk feet without getting hassled. If you havent planned this already, use one of those free days in Cairo and take a day trip to Alexandria. Its six hours in a car round trip but the time you spend in the city is well worth it. It was one of my favorite parts of Egypt. Sphinx, Great Pyramids, museums all great. Make sure you get tickets to both the Egyptian museum and the civilization museum. One has all the mummies and that was awesome to walk through. Your daughters are probably going to have the worst of it. Please ask them to dress as conservatively as possible or theyre going to have a bad time. Hell, my wife was wearing my clothes while we were in Cairo because the airline lost her luggage, and she was still getting stared down and targeted pretty hard., The best thing about Cairo is leaving it. On the bright side, the trauma bonding will bring your family closer , My family did this exact itinerary more than a decade ago but still. Cairo was the worst part of our trip. I would cut it shorter if you can. We added on a few days in Hurghada for scuba if that is your cup of tea., The pyramids were very cool and it was worth it for me female, traveling with my husband and children but I hated Cairo otherwise. Ive traveled solo through India and Bangladesh and i did not feel okay leaving the apartment in Cairo without my husband. And even with my husband, nonstop harassment for me and my children. And the air quality is awful. I have asthma and couldnt breathe the whole time. Still, however, unbelievable to see such well preserved ancient history, i think it was worth it but Id never go back., Was in Cairo in my s. Got incessantly harassed. Learned that you cant walk with grocery bags in your hands as men take it as an opportunity to grab your crotch or breasts while your arms are full. Was groped at the pyramids by a police officer. Told the management of my hotel that I had been harassed by a police man and they were very kind, sat me down with a cup of tea and empathized but said there is no point reporting it to anyone as nothing would be done.

Starbursts, Gushers, Jolly Ranchers, etc. It is also difficult to find good quality chocolate. Lindor Truffles or Ghirardelli Squares should be a great treat. Lastly is probably coffee beans.

Also, try to bring an assortment if they arent asking for a particular brand. I avoid American chocolate anything as American chocolate is, um, crap to be honest.

Sneakers extra pair My wife brought a suitcase and I managed to sneak a pair of dress shoes in her bag for dinners out. By the end of the trip we had acquired a lot of souvenirs. I ended up visiting a North Face store and buying a Base Camp Duffel for the trip back. This became my carryon and the backpack was my personal item.

So many people made our public transport experiences really unpleasant with incredibly potent B.O. hygiene is just polite. Dont skimp on smell! . Dont overthink bag selection!!

Cheap Amazon packing cubes are all you need. . Unless you are hiking dont worry about a waist belt. the most I ever wore my bag walking was maybe minutes. THINGS I WISH I BROUGHT AND HAD TO BUY . Technical fabric pants. Jeans in the rain was miserable. Ended up buying overpriced north face hiking pants as a result. Leaving my prana pants at home was dumb. . Nicer dress outfit.

For dinners out and some fancy stuff I just packed a button down shirt, paired with black stretchy jeans and it was more than ok! Also, my wife went with a suitcase and a small backpack and I even ended up carrying some of her stuff.

Dry faster if you get rained on, You, along with Darn Touth and Osperey Nebula are not the only fan in France. yuhoo., take care of your personal hygiene, use deodorant and especially for onebaggers make sure your laundry protocol is sufficient, but maybe pass the cologne on public transport. It wont make the other smell go away anyway, and people can be allergic to strong smells, they can trigger migraines etc., Why the Airtags?, Yah jeans are not for travelling Maybe some technical fabric jeanslike pants of you really like jeans.

Just wait until youre on the way., I try to know where Im going at least months in advance. Right now, I have my plan sorted all the way to things can obviously still change tho, so generally I book or months in advance. For example, Ill be staying in Japan in late November, but Im booking the place maybe with AirBnB... maybe not in early July., I have things booked until late November this year and I am about to start looking for December. Summer in Europe I always have booked by February, if not earlier., deleted, Ive booked a few days ahead and had no problems. Some cities like Istanbul have so many places that the prices will be the same, even at the last minute. Look into the supply and demand of Airbnbs in your location., I usually have everything booked months into the future. Currently I have all my flights and Airbnbs booked till the end of October., As soon as we buy the airplane tickets., Months ahead if possible, The best time to book is months out. The second best is less than one week., weeks normally., Usually when Im at the airport waiting to fly to my destination. I like the spontaneous nature of adventure. Its always worked out. I rarely get an Airbnb for more than a few days then discuss a more long term stay after Ive been there a while and figured out the space worked for me., The day before, At the beginning and height of the pandemic, it was hard to plan too far ahead things changed so often! I rarely booked more than months in advance. By contrast, right now Im booked into November. But planning too far ahead cuts you off from lastminute opportunities that may arise on sites like Trusted Housesitters. Im going to try to keep my schedule more open for that reason., As soon as I know for sure I will be there. However, I often dont know what Im going to do until a few days to a week before, as I update my plans based on new information. If theres a big event going on that I want to attend, I usually book more like weeks in advance., Normally months in advance. Ive been in Japan and Korea now though, and for them I needed to book months in advance. But I go for pretty low prices, so I want to be early to get the best ones, I get a hotel bc fuck airbnb, months, I try completely avoid AirBnB. It is one of those corporations that only cares about profit with no regard for the communities they operate in., Im currently booked through February , and plan to start booking the next round in September. So roughly six to nine months out., Usually a month or two ahead, no matter what. I always book for a month long stay, and of the time stay below mo Latin America, previously southwestern Europe as well, before prices went crazy. I just counted all my stays vs cancels since when I joined. Kind of ashamed at my numbers. stays and cancels mine, not the hosts. Luckily all my reviews are very positive. Glad I got refunded on most of those cancelations. I probably throw away per year on canceled reservations when plans change and another lost on flights. I just cant book far out cause I frequently change my mind, so month to month is better. (Score: 0.46192750334739685)\n",

I just did a search for nonstop flights from my local airport during a random week in August as a test, and a big map came up that shows me that I could go to Anchorage for , Dubai for , Lisbon for , or Montreal for . So you could probably find all sorts of options that way? There are lots of filters if you have a particular distance, price, number of stops, etc. in mind., Beaches, culture, museums, food, and the occasional mountain? Go to Spain. Its also a very hospitable country with great tourism infrastructure so good for a firsttime solo traveller., I tried that dart thing once!! Spent two weeks vacationing behind my refrigerator. , I have a half dozen trips on the list. The way I narrow it down for what is next is Compelling Event Is there some event museum exhibit, concert, theater, etc or seasonal event that necessitates putting that location higher up on the list or doing it asap. This can also be as simple as I have PTO I have to use at X time, what on my list is better to travel then? But also sometimes Is the offseason for this place safe aka not in Hurrican season and so is just shitty weather? Are my planned interestsactivities weather dependent? I then look at limiting factors Time How much time do I have off, and which destinations would be a good fit for that timerange. Ive got some dream ish week trips, and a few week trips, and a few week long or weekend long trips in my mind. BudgetMoney Which on the list can I afford to do? Which might be cheaper to do now? Does one place on the list have cheaper flights, hotels, etc? Other factors Such as which ones can I do solo? From here I may have a list of a few options. Ill do more research and then decide from that. Sometimes there is an internal theme Im wanting to do. Maybe Im burnt out at work and want a more relaxing tropical vacation. Maybe Im hungering for adventure. Maybe I want to splurge on luxury, or maybe I want to indulge the child in me who wanted to be Indiana Jones or a museum curator and go with something museumancient history oriented. Im now in a place where I can splurge so lately Ive been doing the What the hell LETS GO BIG and doing the top dream trip from the list., My husband and I wanted to go somewhere and we didnt know where, so we literally looked up the furthest nonstop flight from our preferred airline and, well, we leave for Seoul tomorrow!, Its a great way to find out where you dont want to go, For your first ever trip, Id recommend something like EnglandScotlandIreland. Itll get you used to being in a foreign country, get your travel legs under you, and everyone still speaks English so you wont have any issues getting help if you run into trouble. After that, the world is your oyster I started with England and was very glad that I did, cause I was able to use what Id learned about travelling when we went to more difficult places like Peru!, Not a dart but Ive put lots of destinations in a hat and drew one before., I think the random thing is a bad move, at least for my style. I dont want to trust my hard earned travel dollars up to chance. Theres no upside to doing that. Id suggest to break out of the indecision by simply pulling the trigger on the most popular budget backpacker destination on the planet SE Asia. Its the perfect choice for an indecisive, nervous first timer. Its safe, inexpensive and has excellent tourist infrastructure. Its completely foreign, but not intimidating. Its the perfect place to learn how to travel. Good luck no matter what you decide. Happy travels., Its not throwing a dart, but I do pick dates and then use google flight map and go where the cheapest flight is., Imo Japan would be great for solo travel but I am biased since I did my first solo there , If this is your first trip, go to Europe, maybe Spain or France. UK or Ireland are good too. The reason is that they are easy places to get around, mostly safe, the water is clean so you wont get sick, and not much of a language barrier as you will find lots of people who speak English. You can stay at hostels save a lot of money and meet people too. You will make mistakes but not much will happen to you, maybe miss a train, etc. Stuff you can solve with a little money. You will learn a lot and be more comfortable traveling by yourself. I also find that traveling in Europe tends to be much cheaper than traveling in the US and way more exciting. Depending on how much time and money you have you could also do several countries. Buy a ticket, say, to Madrid and get your return ticket out of maybe Amsterdam. Then your adventure is the journey from Madrid to Amsterdam. Or into Paris and out of London, etc. You get the idea. Good luck!, Picking a random place is a terrible idea for a starter trip. If youre starting traveling then focus on reducing some of the friction so youll want a place where you can get by with the languages you already speak, relatively low crime, available hotels, functioning bank system, etc. Im all for going to riskierout of the way type places, but get some experience first, just so you can deal with the issues that arise. From the west coast of the US, Id suggest Japan as an ideal starter holiday. Youll get to explore a very different culture, but in a country that functions smoothly enough that no issues will be particularly difficult to solve. Plus it ticks your boxes. Maybe iffy on beaches, but for the rest of them., I dont throw a dart at a map, but my selection process could potentially be just as random. I set prices for parts of the world say for Europe, for Caribbean, for Hawaii and so on. Then when one of my alerts trips I check it out. If the details are not terrible long layovers etc I book it. Usually this takes less than an hour, sometimes these flight deals disappear fast. Once I have the flights I start looking at lodging and then finally activities. This often means that Im traveling off season but I like skipping the crowds anyway and a little cold or rain never bothered me much. My default is days. Not sure why I picked as the trips usually start mid week, so Im typically not even taking advantage of two weekends. Thats just when the flights are usually cheap. If Im going somewhere anything less than days just feels like its not worth the effort. Lately Ive been watching travel zoo as they have a bunch of all inclusive type packages for destinations in Europe and Asia. I found a trip to Portugal there that was run out of a travel agency in Spain. It was really economical, something like for days including flights and hotel and a tour bus and guide and admission to sites. Id probably do something like that again, I could probably do it myself for a little cheaper, but it was nice not having to drive or decide what to do or where to go or figure out parking in a rental car., Croatia!, Given how shitty I am at darts Id hit something like Syria or South Sudan and end up in big trouble., South east Asia. Ive been to Bali times, the Philippines twice, Hong Kong and Malaysia. I would definitely recommend the Philippines for what youre looking for., I often just go to places that have good deals on flight if Im feeling like exploring whatever. Check out Explore on Google Flights or similar., Thailand is one of the best., My husband and I did the throw a dart thing once, he threw one and I threw one and we decided between the two states in the US.

Its also been a decade since I was in either place on a shoestring budget as a Peace Corps Volunteer, so I cant speak to how well they meet your budget constraints in . However, both are quite tourist friendly in particular, Namibia is extremely safe and welcoming, offer access to interesting landscapes Skeleton Coast and dunes in Namibia, Table Mountain in SA and wildlife seal colonies in Namibia, penguins in SA, as well as being urban areas worth exploring., Senegal, Take a look at Tunisia.

The flight is extremely affordable. Its not that far while there are no nonstop flights at least from NYC, theres a layover in places like Portgual or Germany also Im not trying to spend an entire day in the air. That they speak French is just a bonus for me personally. If I had the time to travel further, Id do Namibia. It looks cool., If were talking sub Saharan Africa then you should include Kenya and Rwanda. Egypt is also in Africa and inexpensive., For budget backpacking, Malawi actually has a pretty good scene. Lots of chill places along the lake and good hiking in the Zomba plateau., I hiked from Morocco to Tanzania. but not Libya Morocco, Egypt, Kenya and Tanzania are my top picks on the easyvalue index. None of these places are easy like Italy. Im not trying to suggest they are. Morocco is easy to get to from the US, and a bargain. See a recent post about Morocco for recommendations. Egypt packs a lot of Ive always wanted to see this in a small footprint. Unfortunately, my favorite part of Egypt is the Sinai and thats too close to trouble for comfort. East Africa is basically the backpackers bucket list region., Ethiopia isnt really cheap and its not a good place to go outside of the capital right now., I wouldnt say theres anything on the level of Mexico or Thailand, but Ghana feels like the right mix for you. Its not expensive, you can do a walking safari at Mole National Park for the price of a latte in North America I paid back in people are extremely friendly, and there seems to be at least a small, burgeoning tourist scene. Safetys good if youre not wandering around after dark a precaution Id take in most African countries anyway. Public transport is cramped and distances are long, but the process is fairly easy. In general, I found it possible to travel cheaply across both West and East Africa, even with safaris. I took public transport throughout. For East Africa costs, accommodation, and transport info, I relied on a lot of information from this website Tanzania safaris can be pretty cheap for what you get you just need to book with a local company once you get there. A week long camping safari can be had in the , range. Thatd include food too. Depending on where youre at, thats only slightly more than your plane ticket. I really enjoyed Tanzania when I went, OP travelling across Africa for less than for a nights accomodation is perfectly possible.

I rent a x car from budget agencies for about usd a day, by far the most expensive cost of the trip. From there food was super cheap, I typically camp which runs night depending on the spot.

Scams didnt bother me cause they have scams everywhere. I dont even say no thanks, I just ignore them. It was being physically touched and groped. I had on very conservative clothes and it never stopped. I cut the trip short. Maybe a tour would be better but solo was horrible for me. Of course, lots of people love it. This is just my experience., is this going to be a constant case of themus being harassed??! If you look European or American Yes, most likely., Egyptian here, expect scams everywhere and dont accept any services from shady strangers. Your daughters shouldnt go anywhere alone and I mean this, keep your eyes open and hold your daughters near you. Try to negotiate the prices everywhere you go because it will probably be higher as you are a tourist this might not work everytime but so be it at least you tried . Stay safe and have fun ., Hello, I just got back from Egypt a couple weeks ago. While it wasnt the worst city I have been to, there are some unfortunate realities that all parties going on the trip should be aware of. Ive visited just over countries across Africa, Asia and Europe and Egypt is unique. Its a place you go to see the pyramids and widen your worldview. Its not a vacation destination. When I arrived at CAI was detained in the airport for no reason other than being an American. They held me and my passport for nearly two hours without cause. I have heard this happening to many other Americans so just be aware. What everyone else is saying about how your daughters will be treated is true. If they are attractive, white, western, women they will be verbally and physically harassed. Its unfortunate but a reality. They should dress modestly, loose fitting, higher neckline clothing and be aware of how to deal with harassment. When I visited the pyramids a sewer line busted over the road so a literal river of shit was flowing and a horse died next to the road due to neglect. I had a friend who was a guide and even with a local, the merchants and scammer harassment is constant. It was not a great experience. The pyramids and sphinx are cool, but their awesomeness was diminished by the surrounding circumstances. The National museum is interesting but its in the middle of the city and traffic can be a nightmare, like literally hours to get across the city, in degree Fahrenheit heat. Its also surrounded by heavily armed guards and if youre not used to AKs and shotguns, it can feel dangerous. It can kill the feeling of a vacation. If you find Egyptian history absolutely fascinating you will find it enjoyable, if you are averagely interested in mummys, its ok. Most of my travel is solo and I really try to explore the cities I visit . Please dont do this in Cairo. You will be relentlessly followed, harassed, scammed, accosted and groped, endlessly. Im not kidding. I am a father and after returning from my visit to Cairo, I cant imagine bringing my daughter, sister, mother or wife with me. And all of them are tough, traveled, women. Unfortunately I think the only real way to enjoy Cairo as a family is to book a tour, an all inclusive one. They are expensive and annoying but they do provide a known product. They take care of the driving, the tickets, accommodations, everything. In a city like Cairo where EVERYONE is desperate for dollars or pounds, its best to stick with a crowd. I think a visit to Egypt can still be a good experience if it is approached in the right mindset. Cairo is not a place for a relaxing vacation, if you go with the intention of learning about history, experiencing the good and bad of other cultures and gaining a greater understanding of global issues, it can be a beneficial trip. If you visit Cairo hoping for a vacation where you can relax, be leisurely, and just have a nice time, I think you will be disappointed and stressed. Best of luck!, My partners family lives in Cairo so we visit each year. Heres my two cents about the city as a white American First and foremost its absolutely worth the visit. The pyramids and the museums are incredible, must visit. Now will you be harassed? Im going to assume youre nonArab and so yes, to buy goods and services, it will be constant in any tourist areas and it can be extremely uncomfortable. Many will be very shady with their pricing as well. You must be stern in negotiating and you must learn how to walk away even if you feel like youre being rude. Sometimes they may get upset and mumble something in Arabic but so be it. Some advice I recommend you remember the phrase net, spasibo. Its Russian for no thank you. Why? Egyptian street merchants are famously multilingual in common phrases and they will not take no for an answer. Its tiring. They know English, French, Spanish and German typically. But one language they dont seem to know any of is Russian. Instead of saying no and being followed for minutes with a man haggling me for something I never expressed any interest in, I say net, spasibo a few times and they walk away frustrated over the perceived language barrier. Never take a camel or carriage ride at the pyramids. For one of the animals are being poorly treated. If you must take a ride negotiate upfront not only the pricing but where exactly youll be going. They will get you on the animal or carriage, and mid way through your journey try to convince you that you need to go to some remote viewing area for the best photos. If youre not careful they will charge way more for letting them. Same applies to tour guides that approach you in the tourist areas. If you find you really want one, get the pricing up front and make sure youre firm about it. Do not let them talk you into extras without specifying what will be their charge. Never accept a simple for you I make good deal dont worry and go on your way. Get the exact amount in poundsdollarseuros. If someone offers to take your photo, its almost guaranteed they want a tip. And Ive even witnessed them refuse to give the phonecamera back until you do tip. Do not buy souvenirs from the pyramids street vendors or local shops. They will charge you way more than if you go to say Khan elKhalili for the same souvenirs. This bazaar is also super touristy but at least the people here are more willing to negotiate pricing. I try to avoid cabs at all costs. They may change the pricing on you even if you agree to a price upfront. And many cab drivers are just Egyptian men with their personal vehicles trying to make money and theres zero accountability if something goes wrong. Uber in Egypt is wonderful and dirt cheap. You can go from one side of Cairo its massive to the other for less than with Uber. Now specifically will the women youre traveling with be harassed? Very likely in the tourist areas. My partner and I are both women. We dress modestly and I recommend they do so as well. Try to avoid tight fitting clothing for example. If they dont theyre likely going to be leered at by horny teenagers and young men. Even dressed modestly we still get unsolicited joking marriage proposals and we have even had a man tell us hed murder his wife for the chance to marry my partner I constantly see these boys and men checking us out. With all of this said, I still love Cairo and I think its worth the visit. Excluding most merchants at tourist destinations, the Egyptian people are incredibly kind and hospitable. Theyre eager to interact with you and share their culture. Theyre a fiercely proud people. As for the merchants, even theyre not bad people, theyre opportunists trying to make ends meet. Edit also consider booking a VIP hotel transfer service from the airport. It can be a little pricy but Cairo airport and customs can be overwhelming your first time. With this service a local will meet you before customs and theyll help you get through. Sometimes there is a long line and you may even be able to bypass it with the assistance of the local. It will help avoid any drama with officials as well. Then theyll drive you to your hotel and you dont have to worry about the cab drivers who will rip you off exceedingly at the airport. if anyone needs Cairo travel advice feel free to reach out and Ill do my best to help! If I dont know the answer, Ill be happy to ask our family in Cairo for their advice , Been there twice. First time on the ground. Wouldnt do that again. The harassment is overwhelming. They dont take no for an answer. Second time we did a Nile cruise, which is absolutely the way to go. Safer, cleaner, fewer scams, less harassment, easier to see more sites. All cruise lines are owned by Egyptbased companies and all are similar size fairly small. Worth it to spend more for a higher end line. Having done this, if we ever go back, wed do cruise again. Be sure to do the Cairo museum. If able, cruising all the way south to see Abu Simbel is pretty epic., One of my friends went to Egypt about months ago and said that was the only place that she ever felt in danger all the time as a woman. She got separated from her group and was groped and accosted by random men. She will never go again, this is from a world traveler., Was in Cairo a few days ago, on my way to East Africa. I didnt really enjoy Cairo. Pros very unique and different. Bustling streets, lots going on. If youre a westerner its cool to see how different life is. Cons the people for the most part are unbearable. Extremely aggressive Ive been to many different countries and cities, Cairo was the worst. They dont take no for an answer. They touch you and try to block your way. Theyre constantly trying to scam you. The animals are treated so poorly, its difficult to see. The pyramids are cool enough, but its way too touristy. The streets are filthy and rundown. That being said, Ive heard great things about other Egyptian cities Aswan, Alexandria. Im also generalizing, as Im sure there are lots of polite and well meaning people in Cairo, I just didnt meet them. It also doesnt help that the contrast between Cairo and people in Tanzania is so sharp. Tanzanians are the most friendly and helpful people Ive met., Dont go anywhere without a guide. Tell the guide that you dont want to go to off the track carpetperfume papyrus places even if its free. They are overpriced and the guide gets a cut from what you buy. Go to the big market cant remember the name now but things are much cheaper there. But you will also need a guide., Male here. Been around the world more or less. Went to Egypt with female friends, worst thing they have experienced and I have seen. Havent been back and dont recommend anyone. A pity really as the history is mindblowing! Just to bad the male culture sucks., Seems accurate. Expect creepy old men to offer to buy your daughters in various livestock. Certainly never let them go anywhere individually. Fly to Luxor, it is the capital for most of ancient Egypt history, so where more of the cool stuff is. The hawkers will still be absurdly agressive. And everyone will try and rip you off. But at least you get to look at cool stuff., Well taking this one off my bucket list after reading all this depressing shit, Hire a guide. They will manage the people harassing you and help you know what to avoid. My guide would warn mewhen we go to the bathrooms there will be people on both sides, keep walking and dont make eye contact, Ill wait for you right outside the door. It made me feel safe and ensured I wasnt ever in a bad situation. Also prepare the kids to dress modestly. Its hot and they may want short shorts and a crop top its not appropriate in Egypt and its going to give your family unwanted attention., Get a guide. Best Cairo investment you can make., I absolutely loathed Cairo. If youre doing a tour Egypt, you should allow for a day to see the pyramids and museums, they are genuinely worth visiting, but the city itself is an ugly concrete jungle. We had a nice female tour guide for the pyramids and she said the old finance company she used to work for would send people to Cairo for meetings etc as punishment. Luxor and Aswan are breathtaking though, It is absolutely not worth exploring Cairo. Its a dump. My wife and I just got back from there. You cant walk feet without getting hassled. If you havent planned this already, use one of those free days in Cairo and take a day trip to Alexandria. Its six hours in a car round trip but the time you spend in the city is well worth it. It was one of my favorite parts of Egypt. Sphinx, Great Pyramids, museums all great. Make sure you get tickets to both the Egyptian museum and the civilization museum. One has all the mummies and that was awesome to walk through. Your daughters are probably going to have the worst of it. Please ask them to dress as conservatively as possible or theyre going to have a bad time. Hell, my wife was wearing my clothes while we were in Cairo because the airline lost her luggage, and she was still getting stared down and targeted pretty hard., The best thing about Cairo is leaving it. On the bright side, the trauma bonding will bring your family closer , My family did this exact itinerary more than a decade ago but still. Cairo was the worst part of our trip.

And the air quality is awful. I have asthma and couldnt breathe the whole time. Still, however, unbelievable to see such well preserved ancient history, i think it was worth it but Id never go back., Was in Cairo in my s. Got incessantly harassed. Learned that you cant walk with grocery bags in your hands as men take it as an opportunity to grab your crotch or breasts while your arms are full. Was groped at the pyramids by a police officer. Told the management of my hotel that I had been harassed by a police man and they were very kind, sat me down with a cup of tea and empathized but said there is no point reporting it to anyone as nothing would be done.

The tres fronteras region adjacent to Salar de Uyuni is one of the only places that may rival the American West for geological beauty while having next to no tourists or infrastructure. It is a wild place wildly beautiful and wildly untouched. However, otherwise, the country has unremarkable food and unfriendly people. Other adjacent countries have both of these and natural beauty Peru, Colombia, Chile come to mind. Sucre may well be my favorite city aesthetically in all of South America but food and people are important. Maybe the case is different in the eastern lowlands near Santa Cruz de la Sierra so Im open to other opinions. Rurrenabaque too often receives praise. I was there a little north of three weeks and visited Salar de Uyuni, Potosi, Sucre, Cochabamba, La Paz including Pico Austria and the Death Road, and Isla de la Sol. Of course, you must absolutely GO and form your own opinion. I went and Im rating it as average. Thank you for sharing your lovely pictures though!, We loved Bolivia. Stunning.

There will be lots of suggestions as well., The biggest request we always get for snacks are peanut butter filled pretzels and Trader Joes candy, especially the dark chocolate peanut butter cups., Peanut butter if you are checking a bag. Good Bp is hard to get here in Mexico City, Wiley Wallaby classic red licorice puts twizzlers to shame. Fruit rollups. Haribo twin snakes, sour streamers. Available at Dollar tree, the mints from Chick fil a I dont even know about this lol, I like the idea of asking Mexicans directly what theyd like. Im curious! I spend a great deal of time in Mexico and Mexico is NOT addicted to sugar like Americans are. The labels state Exceso de Azucar Calorias Excesivas The natives shop several times weekly for fresh items. The refrigerators are not the size of mini vans. They dont use preservatives. The first time I bit into a cinnamon roll I was thinking Cinnabon. Boy, was I surprised! Not sweet. In some of the heavy expat towns you may find treats and Pancake houses that appeal to Americans and Canadians, usually made by and owned by Americans and Canadians. That being said, in the convenience stores have Hostess like snacks, Tostitos with Tajin and chips that resemble Lays, but really its not like the US., Voodoo potato chips, small bags at the dollar tree if you want to get multiple bags, or large bag for each house from the grocery store. If youre going to trader Joes maybe the jars of cookie butter. Fancy ramen like nissen roah, Goldfish and cheezits, Ghiradelli and reeses, Do you have anything that is particularly significant in your hometown? Pralines, for example. Or something baked. A cookbook of local dishes could be nice., Fruity snacks seem to be the most difficult to find in Mexico. Starbursts, Gushers, Jolly Ranchers, etc. It is also difficult to find good quality chocolate. Lindor Truffles or Ghirardelli Squares should be a great treat. Lastly is probably coffee beans. I have drank probably over cups of coffee in Mexico and it never seems to be very good quality. If you can snag a good bag of quality whole coffee beans, it will probably be a treat., Take some Oreos. Mexican Oreos are terrible, Trader Joes all the way., Take them girl scout cookies. The boxes are of easy sizes to travel with and certainly not heavy. And Ive never seen them for sale in CDMX. Plus they are delicious treats. Some of the items listed in the thread can be found around CDMX, perhaps not your local tiendita in the neighborhood but certainly in Chedraui Select, Walmart, specialty stores, Liverpool. My favorite candy store near metro Balderas is chock full of American and European candies., Pop tarts, When I go and visit friends overseas I like to bring a box of Sees Candy. If you can get an idea of what they like eg milk or dark chocolate, nuts vs fruit filling, the boxes are customizable if you visit the store. I cant speak to their online service because I have never used them. I would also suggest, as others have mentioned, regional specialties., My family always does boxes of sees candy. My family in Mexico loves it, buy some rye chips they are amazing, As a generality for most countries.. bring craft or regional snacks if in doubt. Most countries tend to have access to most common American brands Coke, Pringles, MMs, and such. Example As a previous respondent noted for potato chips, a brand like VooDoo works well. Also, try to bring an assortment if they arent asking for a particular brand. I avoid American chocolate anything as American chocolate is, um, crap to be honest. If you must bring some chocolate, get some English chocolate like Lion, Aero or Flake this assumes you are not going to the UK, Canada, Australia, etc, of course. And that brings up another point unless asked, you dont have to bring items specifically from where you live. Ill bring some of the best I have access to that I have come across.

            "Retrieved: OPs context comment Spent my honeymoon in the south of France for almost a month! This was my first one bag trip. Didnt get a full pack photo totally forgot but as I remember my packing was as such . Two pairs of shorts . Tevas sandals . Toiletry bag . iPad . Underwear . tshirts . Black jeans . Tech bag cables, battery bank, etc. . Kindle . button up shirts . jacket . hoodie . Patagonia black hole sling . Sneakers extra pair My wife brought a suitcase and I managed to sneak a pair of dress shoes in her bag for dinners out. By the end of the trip we had acquired a lot of souvenirs. I ended up visiting a North Face store and buying a Base Camp Duffel for the trip back. This became my carryon and the backpack was my personal item. Learned a lot on this trip wanted to share my thoughts. . Cologne and Deodorant are a must. So many people made our public transport experiences really unpleasant with incredibly potent B.O. hygiene is just polite. Dont skimp on smell! . Dont overthink bag selection!! I went with a bag that was not marketed for travel. I already owned it and committed to the challenge. It worked wonderfully. By not buying a new travel bag for the trip I had budget to buy a carryon at my destination. . Buying a larger carryon bag at my destination was so worth it. Love my base camp duffel. . My iPad came in handy so much. . Dress code is worth the weight! Pack a nice outfit. . My lululemon pacebreaker shorts were incredibly comfortable and worth every penny. . My Patagonia black hole sling was great . My darn tough socks were worth their weight in gold. . Do laundry in the sink. Easy and cheap. . Buy a few AirTags!!! . Two pairs of sneakers is overkill. . Cheap Amazon packing cubes are all you need. . Unless you are hiking dont worry about a waist belt. the most I ever wore my bag walking was maybe minutes. THINGS I WISH I BROUGHT AND HAD TO BUY . Technical fabric pants. Jeans in the rain was miserable. Ended up buying overpriced north face hiking pants as a result. Leaving my prana pants at home was dumb. . Nicer dress outfit. So expensive to buy in Europe and the shopping trip ate into our day. All to visit a couple of fancier places. Thats really it! Ultimately just wanted to share this with the community., I typically travel with an Osprey Fairpoint . Its has the right amount space for me to pack for any trip Ive been irrespective of the length of the trip., I also went for a onebag honeymoon with an Osprey Metron. I packed that thing to the last bit for a month, not a single scar on it. I went with just two shoes A sneaker that looked good on occasions and some Xero sandals for the beach and casual walking. A small rainjacket was more than enough if it got a bit cold or a summer storm hit us. For dinners out and some fancy stuff I just packed a button down shirt, paired with black stretchy jeans and it was more than ok! Also, my wife went with a suitcase and a small backpack and I even ended up carrying some of her stuff. It was liberating traveling with so less that moving from place to place didnt feel like a punishment., Have u been happy with the Backpack?, Ive had my Osprey Nebula for a few years and I use it for absolutely everything. Ive done a few month long trips with it and it works wonderfully for my needs. Yours looks different than mine though., What would you take for a dress outfit? What situations?, Thanks OP, nice review. For others who are researching purchasing a onebag, last year I landed on the BANGE Overnight Backpack L Carryon approved for domesticInt flights, and served me very well for wk EU trip UK FR ESP. Also on the recommendation for packing one nice outfit for classier outings. Edit clarity, What did you use the iPad for? Did you bring headphonesAirpods?, Nice! What L was the Duffel you ended up buying?, Here here on jeans. I dont understand why people insist on traveling with them. Technical pants pack smaller and dry fast, Try lululemon abc pants. Comfortable, thin, light. Look decent. Dry faster if you get rained on, You, along with Darn Touth and Osperey Nebula are not the only fan in France. yuhoo., take care of your personal hygiene, use deodorant and especially for onebaggers make sure your laundry protocol is sufficient, but maybe pass the cologne on public transport. It wont make the other smell go away anyway, and people can be allergic to strong smells, they can trigger migraines etc., Why the Airtags?, Yah jeans are not for travelling Maybe some technical fabric jeanslike pants of you really like jeans. Outlier has some great ones I used a lot last France trip. Also dry way faster., how did you dry clothes? and how long did it take?, Guys. a honeymoon is not the time to be one bagging. If I were your wife Id be slightly annoyed. You can easily take a small carry on plus a small backpack and it wouldve made your entire travel much easier, with extra room to bring stuff like nice clothes like duh youre gonna need that its a honeymoon and buy souvenirs., When you say nicer dress outfit that you bought on the trip, what items specifically?, traveled mo in Europe with a carryon, I can vouch for all said above (Score: 0.45085981488227844)\n",

This will give you access to a debit card that refunds foreign transaction fees and ATM fees, and charges the current exchange rate, which is currently around AU $0.75 for every US dollar. This can save you a significant amount of money compared to using a regular credit card or withdrawing cash from ATMs with high fees. Additionally, some Australian banks like Commonwealth Bank (CommBank) offer free travel cards that can be used to avoid international fees. I would suggest checking out CommBank's options as they may work better for you than the Qantas Travel Card you mentioned in your question. Overall, these strategies can help you manage your finances more efficiently while traveling in Australia and\"}]\n",

However, I would recommend applying for a Brazilian e-visa, which can be obtained online and is valid for up to 90 days. This will save you time and hassle at the embassy or consulate. If you plan to stay in Brazil for more than 90 days, you will need to apply for a traditional visa.\\n\\nRegarding my previous recommendation, I highly suggest taking your time and exploring Brazil for at least two months. Brazil is a vast and diverse country, and there is so much to see and experience. From the vibrant cities of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo to the stunning beaches and rainforests, Brazil has something for everyone.\\n\\nTo help you save money while traveling, I would suggest considering pet sitting with TrustedHousesitters.'}]\n",

The London Underground (also known as the Tube) is a fast and efficient way to travel, with 11 lines covering most of the city. You can also use buses, which are frequent and cover all areas of London. Another option is the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), which connects the city to the Docklands area. If you prefer a more scenic route, you can also take a boat along the Thames River, which offers stunning views of the city. Whichever mode of transportation you choose, make sure to purchase an Oyster card or contactless payment card, which will give you discounted fares and make traveling around London a breeze.'}]\n"

            "(\"{'query': 'What is the best time to visit Paris?'}\", 'Depends on where and when youre going. Paris in spring? Book months out or more Porto in July? Good luck, should have booked last year. Most of Cental America? Just wait until youre on the way., I try to know where Im going at least months in advance. Right now, I have my plan sorted all the way to things can obviously still change tho, so generally I book or months in advance. For example, Ill be staying in Japan in late November, but Im booking the place maybe with AirBnB... maybe not in early July., I have things booked until late November this year and I am about to start looking for December. Summer in Europe I always have booked by February, if not earlier., deleted, Ive booked a few days ahead and had no problems. Some cities like Istanbul have so many places that the prices will be the same, even at the last minute. Look into the supply and demand of Airbnbs in your location., I usually have everything booked months into the future. Currently I have all my flights and Airbnbs booked till the end of October., As soon as we buy the airplane tickets., Months ahead if possible, The best time to book is months out. The second best is less than one week., weeks normally., Usually when Im at the airport waiting to fly to my destination. I like the spontaneous nature of adventure. Its always worked out. I rarely get an Airbnb for more than a few days then discuss a more long term stay after Ive been there a while and figured out the space worked for me., The day before, At the beginning and height of the pandemic, it was hard to plan too far ahead things changed so often! I rarely booked more than months in advance. By contrast, right now Im booked into November. But planning too far ahead cuts you off from lastminute opportunities that may arise on sites like Trusted Housesitters. Im going to try to keep my schedule more open for that reason., As soon as I know for sure I will be there. However, I often dont know what Im going to do until a few days to a week before, as I update my plans based on new information. If theres a big event going on that I want to attend, I usually book more like weeks in advance., Normally months in advance. Ive been in Japan and Korea now though, and for them I needed to book months in advance. But I go for pretty low prices, so I want to be early to get the best ones, I get a hotel bc fuck airbnb, months, I try completely avoid AirBnB. It is one of those corporations that only cares about profit with no regard for the communities they operate in., Im currently booked through February , and plan to start booking the next round in September. So roughly six to nine months out., Usually a month or two ahead, no matter what. I always book for a month long stay, and of the time stay below mo Latin America, previously southwestern Europe as well, before prices went crazy. I just counted all my stays vs cancels since when I joined. Kind of ashamed at my numbers. stays and cancels mine, not the hosts. Luckily all my reviews are very positive. Glad I got refunded on most of those cancelations. I probably throw away per year on canceled reservations when plans change and another lost on flights. I just cant book far out cause I frequently change my mind, so month to month is better.', ' \"Based on the recommended answer, it\\'s best to book accommodations in Paris months in advance, especially during popular times like spring.
